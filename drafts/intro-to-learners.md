# Learners

**Learners** are participants in [learning circles](../learning-circles/learning-circles-1.md). No matter your age, skills, or background—if you want to learn a new skill or topic with other people, you can be a learner!

## Why learning circles?

There's a lot of free knowledge available in the world, but it can be intimidating, lonely, or ineffective to work through new information on your own. We believe that learning with other people is the best way to gain a well-rounded perspective on a topic and remember what you've learned.

Learning circles help people find a supportive environment to learn about a topic they care about with like-minded members of their community. 

Learning circles are:

* **Free** to join
* **Adaptable** to your personal interests, needs, and priorities
* **Effective** in supporting the completion of online courses
* **Social** and collaborative to help people connect with their community

## Finding Available Learning Circles

You can see a list of learning circles open for sign-up using the [**learning circle search page**](https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-circles/). Along with a list of available learning circles, there are tools to search by keywords \(ex. "job skills" or "coding"\) and filters to let you search by location, topics, and meeting days.

## Starting a Learning Circle

If there are no learning circles happening in your area, there are two ways that you can start one! 

1. \*\*\*\*[**Facilitate a learning circle**](../facilitation/intro-to-facilitation/) yourself – this involves finding an online course you want to work through, picking a meeting space and time, and using P2PU's free tools to start a group
2. Contact your local library to request they start a learning circle program
