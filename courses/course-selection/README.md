# Course Selection

## Searching for courses

You can use any course you want to run a learning circle, so long as it is free for the participants. There are a few different ways to search for courses.

**1. SEE WHAT WE’VE ALREADY GOT**  
Firstly, you should know that the P2PU community documents courses that we think work well as learning circles here: [https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/). You can sort by the most popular courses and filter by subject.

[![courses](https://community.p2pu.org/uploads/default/original/1X/08f11534ba7373ad6f2e56d98144807f3aa30ffb.gif)](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/)

**2. SEARCH BY AGGREGATOR**  
If you can’t find something on the P2PU site, try an aggregator or search engine that looks at courses across multiple platforms. Two of our favorites are:

* [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) stays up-to-date highlighting free online courses from around the web.
* [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) has a nice search, allowing you to search for certain subjects by a number of different filters including start date and course rating.

**3. SEARCH BY PLATFORM**  
The most up-to-date lists of online course will be found by looking at the sites where the courses are made. However, it’s a bit more time intensive. Some popular platforms for courses that get used in learning circles are:

* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
* [edX](https://www.edx.org/)
* [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [MIT OpenCourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
* [NovoEd](http://novoed.com/)
* [OERu](https://oeru.org/)
* [Saylor](https://www.saylor.org/)
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

**4. A FEW EXTRA NOTES**

* If you find a good course that isn’t already on the P2PU courses page then [you can add it yourself](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/) so that other facilitators can easily find it in the future.
* [If there is a topic you are interested in but can’t find a good course anywhere, please add that topic to this list!](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-topics-are-missing/2786)
* When you’re looking, you may want to refer to this post on [what to look for in a good online course.](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-to-look-for-in-a-course/2756)

## Common types of online courses

Online courses come in all sorts of varieties. They might be authored by subject-matter experts, faculty members, learning designers, or hobbyists. They might be hosted on somebody’s personal website, or they might be part of a broader university effort. Some courses are OER, meaning that they come with a license that allows for both re-use and adaptation, while others are free to use but maintain copyright, preventing users from remixing the course materials to better address their own needs. There are four common types of courses that we encounter in learning circles:

* **Courses** **that** **carry** **an open** **license** are known as Open Education Resources or OER. OER is not only free to access, but also allows for repurposing by users. This means we can host old versions, translate activities, and adapt materials for use in new contexts. We prefer working with OER because we know we will always retain the right to access these materials.
  * Examples: [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Open Learning Initiative](https://oli.cmu.edu/), [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/). [OERu](https://oeru.org/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Saylor Academy](https://www.saylor.org/) and [Skills Commons](https://www.skillscommons.org/).
* **Courses** **that** **are** **free** **but** **not** **open** comprise the vast majority of courses currently used for learning circles. While the quality of these courses is often good, there is a risk that these courses might not always be around, as they sometimes get taken offline or put behind paywalls.
  * Examples: [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).
* **Free/open-access** **tools** **and** **databases** can serve as the foundation of a great learning circle. Facilitators have developed light curricula around these tools to help create a group environment.
  * Examples: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Youtube](https://youtube.com/), and [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
* **Proprietary** **courses** charge licensing fees in order to access materials. While we don’t allow for learning circles to charge learners to participate, oftentimes libraries and school systems will have existing contracts with these vendors, and in this case, it’s fine to run them as a learning circle. If you choose a course from a proprietary vendor, you’ll be able to run a learning circle with it but the course will not be visible to others on the P2PU course database.
  * Examples: [GALE Courses](https://www.gale.com/c/gale-courses), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), and [Universal Class](https://library.universalclass.com/index.htm).
