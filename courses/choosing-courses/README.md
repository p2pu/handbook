# Choosing a Course

Learning circles come together around a topic of common interest, supported by freely accessible learning resources. While the facilitator is not expected to be an expert in the subject, it's their job to identify these resources before the learning circle begins. Many facilitators use free online courses for subject material because they are designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study. 

While these so-called "[MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)" work quite well as the content basis for learning circles, there is a [much broader world](finding-courses.md) of freely available information that we encourage facilitators to consider. Many successful learning circles have been run with learning material that doesn't so clearly resemble a course, ranging from a YouTube playlist to a software tutorial to the US Citizenship Exam website. With some time and practice, nearly any learning resource can be [adapted](../../facilitation/learning-circle-checklist/adapting-courses.md) to the learning circle model.

This does not mean, however, that all courses are created equally. P2PU has a [firm stance](evaluating-courses.md) on what attributes best embody the values of a learning circle while simultaneously easing the work for facilitators. Sometimes, this requires adapting the learning materials and creating a facilitator guide. Courses that meet these characteristics are featured on [P2PU's course library](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/).

A final note: Regardless of where the content comes from, there is no such thing as a perfect course! No matter how well content is arranged, a course will never know you as a person, help you make decisions, or tell you when you need to look for answers somewhere else. The learning circle format and the power of peer learning do a lot of work to create a great learning experience. At its best, a course is a starting point for a community of learners to reach common goal, wherever that path may lead. 

### Adding a Course to the P2PU Course Library

Anybody with a P2PU account can add a course to the P2PU course library by filling out the "[Add a Course](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/)" form, which requires the following information:

* Title
* Website
* Creator
* Short description
* Availability
* Topic tags
* Language

Once the form is filled out, the course will be immediately findable on the P2PU course library. P2PU moderates this list and will use its discretion to remove any incomplete or otherwise inappropriate courses.
