# Design the Course

Building on the [four-part meeting structure](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYBhjzuJihzALUsjUK5/methodology/learning-circle-structure), there are some principles for learning design that work well for learning circle regardless of the subject matter.

* **Project-based &gt; theoretical:** Learning circles work well when participants are working towards a shared goal. Frame your learning circle more towards “Learn to Write Fiction” than “Composition 101”; more towards “Build a website” than “Intro to HTML/CSS”.
* **Personal &gt; “objective”:** You are human! Be clear about your expertise, perspective, and motivation in creating this course. Own your expertise, and don’t try and hide behind the cloak of objectivity. 
* **Group discussion &gt; user interaction:** Rely on the relationships formed in the learning circle rather than overbuilding interactivity into the course. Personal exploration comes through discussion questions, not quizzes.
* **Clear &gt; complicated:** Don’t use jargon or complex language when something simple will do. We like to run copy through the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) and target a Grade 8-10 reading level.
* **Quality &gt; quantity:** Where possible, provide a variety of forms of engagement. We like to mix up text, videos, downloadable handouts/exercises, and linking out to interactive tools and resources.
* **Further exploration &gt; homework:** Ideally, learners can have a successful learning circle experience without doing any homework outside of the meetings. That being said, your course doesn’t need to be an end-all-be-all: feel free to include opportunities for further work.
* **Self/peer evaluation &gt; exams:** Think about assessment as an opportunity for personal and group reflection, rather than a test that needs to be passed.
* **Transparency &gt; hierarchy:** Generally, a facilitator shouldn’t need a separate facilitation guide in order to run a learning circle. When thinking about the voice that you use, imagine a group working through the materials together, rather than a teacher imparting knowledge to a classroom.
* **Connected &gt; silo:** Don’t feel like you need to present yourself as the single authority on the subject: Helping people find what they’re looking for is more important than increasing course retention.
* **Open &gt; Closed:** We license course materials with a [Creative Commons BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) license, which means that anybody can reuse or remix our content so long as they attribute us \(BY\) and share their derivative work with the same license \(SA=Share Alike\).
