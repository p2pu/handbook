# Establish Goals & Outcomes

Before drafting content, first identify the audience whom you are trying to serve and outline appropriate learning goals for the course. A few questions to ponder:

**Who are you creating this course for?** 

You should have an understanding of who you are creating this course for, and why. A helpful way to articulate this is to think about the minimal set of qualifications you have for a participant. Are there certain skills \(language fluency, digital literacy, access to materials\) that will define who can access your course? Is it relevant only for people in a particular country or region?

**What expectations will participants bring to this course?** 

People will show up to a learning circle with their own expectations about the subject matter. Understanding the outcomes that participants will be hoping for as well as the preconceptions that they may bring to the learning circle will help you scope out a goal that is both rewarding and also appropriate given the format and time allotted.

**How will you know if participants have succeeded?** 

Considering how to frame participant success is a helpful guide for organizing learning content and creating valuable activities. Assessment guides for facilitators and learners can also be baked into a course, though their relevance can vary by the topic.

* Is there a particular way that you expect participants to demonstrate mastery of this topic?
* If your goal is to help people begin exploring a topic, what do you hope they come away with?
* Can participation in the learning circle inform the evolution of your course materials?
