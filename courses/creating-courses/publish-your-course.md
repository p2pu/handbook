# Publish Your Course

Once you’ve drafted your course content, it’s time to get it online. There are a number of considerations to make when choosing where to host your course:

* Are there platforms that you’re already familiar with?
* What types of media and interactivity do you want to include?
* How do you plan to maintain the course long-term?
* What technical skills do you have? What do you want to practice?

### Course-in-a-Box

[Course-in-a-Box](https://howto.p2pu.org/) is P2PU’s tool for building and publishing online courses, built on the premise that you don’t need to spend money to produce a course that can stay around for a long time. While no prior coding experience is required to use Course-in-a-Box, it still provides great exposure to some of the building blocks of web development including HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Git. It’s free to use and 100% open source \([see GitHub repository](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box)\), so you can adapt it to suit your needs however you choose.  Examples of courses built using Course-in-a-Box include: 

* [Making and Learning](http://p2pu.github.io/makingandlearning/) \(Pittsburgh Children’s Museum\)
* [We Are AI](https://p2pu.github.io/we-are-ai/) \(New York University\)
* [How to Talk About Race](http://how-to-talk-about-race.p2pu.org/) \(Amrita S. Patel and Denise LaForce\)
* [Learning about Learning Circles](https://p2pu.github.io/learning-about-learning-circles/) \(P2PU\)

### Not Course-in-a-Box

#### Browser-based word processors

If Course-in-a-Box seems like a heavy lift, it may be sufficient to keep your course materials in a browser-based word document. This is especially popular if your “course” is more of a facilitation guide designed to complement an existing learning resource. You can draft the materials in whatever tool you’re comfortable with, including Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, or P2PU’s hosted version of [Etherpad](https://etherpad.p2pu.org/). Examples include: 

* [1619 Project](https://community.p2pu.org/t/the-1619-project-new-york-times/4739/2) \(Ulonda at Charlotte Mecklenburg Library\)
* [ 21-Day Racial Equity and Social Justice Challenge](https://community.p2pu.org/t/21-day-racial-equity-social-justice-ywca-greater-cleveland/4770/2) \(same as above\)

#### Ready-to-use website builders

[Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) remains the world’s most popular website builder, as it strikes a good balance between ease of use, customizability, and cost. This is what Jordan from Boston Public Library used to create their [series of learning circle courses about fiction writing](https://learntowritefiction.net/). There are plenty of [Wordpress alternatives](https://www.namecheap.com/wordpress/wordpress-vs-other-content-management-systems/), including Drupal, Joomla, and Squarespace, though beware: as customizability increases, so does cost. 

**Static site generators & hosting solution**

The most flexibility for minimal/no cost will come by combining an [open source, static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) \(e.g. Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy\) with a hosting solution \(e.g. Github Pages, Netlify\): this is the approach that we used to build [Course-in-a-Box](https://docs.google.com/document/d/116fJM3GS7XDzilUOL_ynMZ0yTncUD6aVUbcQKsTra6U/edit#heading=h.96685ia69v99). While highly customizable, this option requires either a technical background or a lot of motivation and patience.

#### Other directions

There are plenty of other formats for hosting content on the web, some of which are explicitly designed for open educational resources. Popular options include:

* Open textbook \(e.g. [Libretext](https://libretexts.org/), [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com/), [EdTechBooks](https://edtechbooks.org/)\)
* Interactive online course \(e.g. [H5P](https://h5p.org/)\)
* Discussion forum \(e.g. [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/)\)
* Blog \(e.g. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Medium](https://www.google.com/search?q=medium&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS726US727&oq=medium&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.1098j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/)\)
* Wiki \(e.g. [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page)\)
* Learning management system \(e.g. [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), [Open edX](https://open.edx.org/)\)
