# Creating a Course

This section is designed to help you design and create an online course for learning circles. Whether you are a subject matter expert or a motivated hobbyist, we believe that you can assemble high-quality learning materials that can be shared with learning communities around the world. Along the way, you’ll also:

* **Learn new skills:** Creating a course is a great way to practice and refine a number of skills, including learning design and web development.
* **Participate in our community:** Course creators are invited to join our community and stay up to date on how their course is being used around the world.
* **Contribute to an OER ecosystem:** By developing an open educational resource, you’re contributing to an equitable process of knowledge sharing. 

The first step to creating a course is to get a good grasp of what learning circles are and how they work. The best way to do that is by participating or facilitating! Reviewing the rest of this guide, particularly the section on [Learning Circle structure,](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MXIxtjgfC1BFKKovPRs/methodology/learning-circle-structure) is helpful too. 



## Outline the Contents

Before drafting content, course creators should first identify the audience they are serving and outline appropriate learning goals.

### Establish Learning Goals

Take the time to establish an outline before diving in and writing content. There are three questions that we ask ourselves as we undertake a course creation project:

1. **Who are you creating this course for?** You should have an understanding of who you are creating this course for, and why. A helpful way to think about this is to write down minimal set of qualifications you have for a participant who joins the learning circle. Are there certain skillsets \(language fluency, digital literacy, access to materials\) that will restrict who can meaningfully engage with your course? Is it relevant only for people in a particular country or region?
2. **What expectations will participants bring to this course?** No matter how clearly you think you outline the scope of the course, people will show up to a learning circle with their own expectations about the subject matter. Understanding the outcomes that participants will be hoping to achieve as well as any preconceptions that they may bring to the learning circle will help you scope out a course that is both rewarding and also appropriate given the format and time allotted.
3. **How will you know if participants have succeeded?** Considering how you expect participants to demonstrate mastery of a topic is an important step in the course creation process. With some topics there will be a very clear artifact that results from the learning circle \(e.g. an updated resume, a new website\); other times it will require participants to articulate progress in a more abstract concept \(e.g. increased confidence using computers, deeper understanding of Caribbean history\).

### Outline Each Module

Once you’ve established the goals for a course, start arranging materials into weekly modules, outlining 2–3 learning goals for each individual meeting. When scoping out the learning goals, keep in mind the 6-8 week length of learning circle: we tend to think about the learning content as being more than a workshop, but less than a semester’s worth of work. 

### Write Course Introduction

Finally, we often find it helpful to take all of this work and summarize it into a first draft of the course landing page. In addition to drafting a course title, you should include:

* Who you are and why you created the course
* Major learning objectives for the course
* Expected pacing for working through the material
* Any needed prerequisites or expectations for participants
* Supplemental resources to help a facilitator prepare
