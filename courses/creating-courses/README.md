# Creating a Course

This section is designed to help you design and create an online course for learning circles. Whether you are a subject matter expert or a motivated hobbyist, we believe that you can assemble high-quality learning materials that can be shared with learning communities around the world. Along the way, you’ll also:

* **Learn new skills:** Creating a course is a great way to practice and refine a number of skills, including learning design and web development.
* **Participate in our community:** Course creators are invited to join our community and stay up to date on how their course is being used around the world.
* **Contribute to an OER ecosystem:** By developing an open educational resource, you’re contributing to an equitable process of knowledge sharing. 

The first step to creating a course is to get a good grasp of what learning circles are and how they work. The best way to do that is by participating or facilitating! Reviewing the rest of this guide, particularly the section on [Learning Circle structure,](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MXIxtjgfC1BFKKovPRs/methodology/learning-circle-structure) is helpful too.
