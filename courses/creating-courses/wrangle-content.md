# Wrangle Content

### Structuring the Course

If you're going to publish your course with Course-in-a-Box, we recommend drafting content in a Google Doc, as it allows for both easy editing and collaboration during the drafting phase as well as conversion to Markdown for when it's time to put the course online \(see more in [Course-in-a-Box documentation](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/modules/content/markdown-and-media/)\).

### Pulling in Third Party Materials

In addition to bringing your own expertise to the table, we encourage course creators to broaden the perspective by referencing or including external content, as long as it can be done appropriately and will full credit to the original sources. Some practices for identifying usable external content: 

* **Quotes and Ideas:** Standard citations rules apply when creating online courses. The [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html) is an exceptional resource for making sure you’re citing things accurately.
* **News Articles:** Linking directly to news articles is a great way to bring in outside opinions and connect your course to current events. Consider using the Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) or [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) to prevent link rot, and be mindful about not linking to articles with paywalls.
* **Images and Icons:** Reuse images and icons from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), [unDraw](https://undraw.co/), [Google Image advanced search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/29508?hl=en), [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/), etc. Each site has clear attribution requirements: generally, this means that you need to cite the author/artist and link back to the original work in your course. 
* **Open Educational Resources:** A number of platforms and individuals license their materials for free reuse, which often means that you choose between linking out to the original source and re-publishing their content directly on your site. We’ve [outlined many platforms](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MXrQ5sgl9wlYpS1c4ys/courses/finding-courses/searching-courses) that utilize Creative Commons \(or equivalent\) licenses; be sure to familiarize yourself with the [various types](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) of CC licenses before republishing anything.

When in doubt, reach out! You might be surprised how responsive people are when you’re trying to share their work with new audiences.
