# Course Selection

Learning circle participants come together around a common interest, supported by freely accessible learning materials. As the facilitator, it is your job to identify these materials before the learning circle begins. Most facilitators use free online courses for subject material because they are widely accessible, developed by subject matter experts, and often designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study. 

P2PU maintains a library of courses that have been successfully run as learning circles on our website.

## Improving the Course Library

You are free, of course, to use any material that you want to run a learning circle. If you have a topic in mind but can’t find something on the P2PU courses page, try an aggregator or search engine that looks at courses across multiple platforms like [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) or [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/). You can also simply search on Google or any other search engine for “free online course in \(whatever topic you want\)”. The P2PU course library is a dynamic, community-powered place. So:

* If you find a good course that isn’t already on the P2PU courses page, [add it yourself](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/) so that other facilitators can easily find it in the future.
* If there is a topic that you're interested in but can't currently find a good course then [add it to this list](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-topics-are-missing/2786)!
* If you want to be so bold as to try and create your own course for learning circles, check out the section on [creating courses](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MXIxtjgfC1BFKKovPRs/course-creators/creating-courses-for-learning-circles).
