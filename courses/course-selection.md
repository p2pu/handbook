# Course Selection

You can use any course you want to run a learning circle, so long as it is free for the participants. The P2PU community documents courses that we think work well as learning circles here: [https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/). You can sort by the most popular courses and filter by subject.

If you can’t find something on the P2PU site, try an aggregator or search engine that looks at courses across multiple platforms like [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) or [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/). Of course, you can also simply search on Google or any other search engine for “free online course in \(whatever topic you want\)”.

If you find a good course that isn’t already on the P2PU courses page then [you can add it yourself](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/) so that other facilitators can easily find it in the future. If there is a topic that you're interested in but can't currently find a good course in the please add it[ to this list!](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-topics-are-missing/2786)
