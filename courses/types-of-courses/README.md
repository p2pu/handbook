# Types of Courses

Organizations who develop content that people have used for learning circles in the past, distinguished by license. Our baseline rule for learning circles is that participants should never have to pay anything to attend, however our long-term vision is that learning circles serve to improve open online learning resources, rather than help institutions justify paying license fees to proprietary vendors.

Online courses come in all sorts of varieties. They might be authored by subject-matter experts, faculty members, learning designers, or hobbyists. They might be hosted on somebody’s personal website, or they might be part of a broader university effort. Some courses are OER, meaning that they come with a license that allows for both re-use and adaptation, while others are free to use but maintain copyright, preventing users from remixing the course materials to better address their own needs. There are four common types of courses that we encounter in learning circles:

* **Courses** **that** **carry** **an open** **license** are known as Open Education Resources or OER. OER is not only free to access, but also allows for repurposing by users. This means we can host old versions, translate activities, and adapt materials for use in new contexts. We prefer working with OER because we know we will always retain the right to access these materials.

  * Examples: [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Open Learning Initiative](https://oli.cmu.edu/), [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/). [OERu](https://oeru.org/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Saylor Academy](https://www.saylor.org/) and [Skills Commons](https://www.skillscommons.org/).

* **Courses** **that** **are** **free** **but** **not** **open** comprise the vast majority of courses currently used for learning circles. While the quality of these courses is often good, there is a risk that these courses might not always be around, as they sometimes get taken offline or put behind paywalls.

  * Examples: [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/)

    and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

* **Free/open-access** **tools** **and** **databases** can serve as the foundation of a great learning circle. Facilitators have developed light curricula around these tools to help create a group environment.

  * Examples: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Youtube](https://youtube.com/), and [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

* **Proprietary** **courses** charge licensing fees in order to access materials. While we don’t allow for learning circles to charge learners to participate, oftentimes libraries and school systems will have existing contracts with these vendors, and in this case, it’s fine to run them as a learning circle. If you choose a course from a proprietary vendor, you’ll be able to run a learning circle with it but the course will not be visible to others on the P2PU course database.
