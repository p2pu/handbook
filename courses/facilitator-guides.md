# Facilitator Guides

Facilitator guides are weekly agendas that help facilitators structure online course materials into a learning circle format.&#x20;

Many online courses are designed for individual study, and this material doesn't always fit neatly into a learning circle structure. Here are some ways you can use facilitator guides to adapt courses to a learning circle format:&#x20;

* Adding [check-ins](https://handbook.p2pu.org/methodology/learning-circle-structure#check-in), icebreakers, and [reflections](https://handbook.p2pu.org/methodology/learning-circle-structure#check-in)
* Changing the length of time devoted to covering a section of the course
  * A common example: A free online course is structured into 4 weeks of 2-hour-long sessions, but your learning circle group can only meet for one hour at a time. Create a facilitator guide to break up the content into 8 weeks of 60-minute-long sessions.
* [Adding or adapting group activities](../methodology/learning-circle-structure.md#learn-and-do)
* Editing the facilitator guide along with participants to take collective notes, to keep track of questions, and to add links to helpful videos, articles, and activities

### Facilitator Guide Template

Facilitators are free to follow whatever process they like! You can create these with any tool you like, including Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, or P2PUâ€™s hosted version of[ Etherpad](https://etherpad.p2pu.org).

P2PU follows this standard template when making new facilitator guides:&#x20;

This template is shared under a CC BY-SA 4.0 and can be freely duplicated, modified, rearranged, or whatever else needed to plan a learning circle. [You can make a copy of it here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozi0IWRkhSamBxYD4l11Dy86TaVhMDiIYZhqFYNGxPM/copy).
