# Adapting Courses

Many facilitators find it helpful to develop a weekly agenda help structure their course materials in the learning circle format. Some facilitators choose to use these just for personal reference while others share them with their learners so everyone can keep track of progress together. You can draft the materials in whatever tool you’re comfortable with, including Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, or P2PU’s hosted version of [Etherpad](https://etherpad.p2pu.org/). 

Whenever possible, P2PU generalizes these agendas and shares them as Facilitator Guides. \(Courses that have an accompanying facilitator guide will soon be noted on the Courses page\). Here are some examples from our community:

* [Social Media: What No One Has Told You about Privacy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_AnvIV-J8u8l3Z7TyqD8csI45sQFCoJyH7C89Df23tg/edit) by Dana 
* [COVID-19, Tackling the Novel Coronavirus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JBfz869HQJ0gtapgYwrYjFfs1cDX7d4POqRBLXD4oSQ/edit) by Sébastien 
* [Job Skills Facilitator Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LtHeCpP39j9SLO9ttRcUwyBh-nziU2AsT6y-jUn1STU/edit) by Zamira

If you'd like to create a facilitator guide, use \[this template\]. You'll find that the activities included in [Typical Structure](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYBqKw2d0_DgWHithpq/methodology/learning-circle-structure) and some of the tips in [Creating a Course](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYBqKw2d0_DgWHithpq/courses/creating-courses/wrangle-content) will help you. If you do this, please share it when you're done!
