# Adapting Courses

Many facilitators find it helpful to develop a weekly agenda help structure their course materials in the learning circle format. Some facilitators choose to use these just for personal reference while others share them with their learners so everyone can keep track of progress together. Whenever possible, P2PU generalizes these agendas and shares them as Facilitator Guides. \(Courses that have an accompanying facilitator guide will soon be noted on the Courses page\). Here are some examples from our community:
