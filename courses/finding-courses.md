# Intro to Courses

Since the facilitator is not expected to be a content expert, learning circles rely on freely-accessible learning materials to convey subject matter expertise. More often than not, this expertise ends up taking the form of a free, online course on so-called "[MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)" platforms like [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). While many of these courses can work quite well for learning circles, there is a wealth of freely available information on the internet that extends far beyond these resources \(see searching for courses\).

In fact, many successful learning circles have been run with learning material that doesn't so clearly resemble a course, ranging from a YouTube playlist to a software tutorial to the US Citizenship Exam website. With some time and practice, nearly any learning resource can be **adapted** to the learning circle model.

This does not mean, however, that all courses are created equally. P2PU has a firm stance on what attributes best embody the values of a learning circle while simultaneously easing the work for facilitators \(see evaluating courses\). Courses that meet these characteristics are featured on [P2PU's course library](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/).

A final note: Regardless of where the content comes from, there is no such thing as a perfect course! No matter how well content is arranged, a course will never know you as a person, help you make decisions, or tell you where to go when you need to look elsewhere for answers. The learning circle format and the power of peer learning do a lot of work to create a great learning experience. At its best, a course is a starting point for a community of learners to reach common goal, wherever that path may lead.
