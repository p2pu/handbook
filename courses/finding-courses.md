# Intro to Courses

Since the facilitator is not expected to be a content expert, learning circles rely on freely-accessible learning materials to convey subject matter expertise. More often than not, this expertise end up taking the form of a free, online course like you might find on edX or Lynda. These courses can work really well, but it's worth remembering that these platforms have a vested interest in making their offerings synonymous with "online learning" at large. 

In reality, there is a wealth of freely available information on the internet, and many successful learning circles have been run with learning material that doesn't so clearly resemble a course. In fact, P2PU believes that with some time and practice, nearly anything learning resource can be adapted to be suitable for the learning circle model. So what are some other places that facilitators might find course material? 

* **Free/Open Source Software:** [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) feature extensive tutorials and online communities.
* **Open Textbooks:** [African Minds](http://www.africanminds.co.za/), [BC Campus Open Ed](https://open.bccampus.ca/), [College of the Canyons](https://www.canyons.edu/Offices/DistanceLearning/OER/Pages/COC%20OER%20Textbooks.aspx), [LibreTexts](https://libretexts.org/), [Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/), and [Openstax](https://openstax.org/) are constantly publishing free textbooks that can be re-organized for learning circles.
* **Databases and Archives**: [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page), [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/), and [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page)...even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Youtube](https://youtube.com/) can serve as the basis for learning circles in an endless array of topics.
* **Books:** [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) and [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) offer millions of books online for free; with a few well thought-out discussion prompts a book group can certainly be a learning circle.

While learning circle course materials can come from almost anywhere, that isn't to say that all courses are created equal. P2PU has identified a few characteristics that work best to both embody the values and ease the logistics of a learning circle. 

* Open Access: Not only free to access, but also [allow for the 5 R's](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/pathways/chapter/reading-the-5rs-of-oer/): retaining, reusing, revising, remixing, and redistributing. The most accessible and most clearly structured, these work great and is what P2PU creates when making courses. 
* Thoughtful Content
* Group Study

Many of the courses that meet these conditions are featured on [P2PU's course library](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/), pulled into our site and benefiting from collective vision of our community, Knowledge sharing between facilitators from around the world. Embodiment of values in the COP that supports.

Regardless of where the content comes from, remember that there is no such thing as a perfect course! The learning circle format and the power of peer learning do a lot of work to create a great learning experience. And while we think that most anything can be adapted for a learning circle, we do have a firm stance on what works best to embody the values and logistics of a learning circle. 

To some degree, the work of turning something into a course is curation: we think thereâ€™s a lot to adapt a learning circle with pretty much any content format.  Read more about adapting courses for learning circles.
