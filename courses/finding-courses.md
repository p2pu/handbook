# Understanding Courses

Since the learning circle facilitator is not expected to be a content expert, it's important to find freely accessible learning materials that can adequately convey expertise in the subject matter at hand. Online courses come in all shapes and sizes but can be largely understood along a spectrum of accessibility and structure.

### Accessibility

**Open Courses** are not only free to access, but also [allow for the 5 R's](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/pathways/chapter/reading-the-5rs-of-oer/): retaining, reusing, revising, remixing, and redistributing. The most accessible and most clearly structured, these work great and is what P2PU creates when making courses. Examples: [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Open Learning Initiative](https://oli.cmu.edu/), [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/). [OERu](https://oeru.org/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Saylor Academy](https://www.saylor.org/) and [Skills Commons](https://www.skillscommons.org/), [DigitalLearn](https://digitallearn.org/), [LumenLearning](https://lumenlearning.com/), [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) & [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/)

**Free Courses** may still grant unlimited access, but limit the extent to which course materials can be translated, adapted, or re-hosted without prior permission. There is the added risk that these materials become unavailable for certain periods of time, go behind a paywall, or go offline completely with no recourse. This comprises the largest chunk of learning circle materials. Examples: [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/),  [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Alison](https://alison.com/courses), [Canvas network](https://www.canvas.net/), [GCF Learn Free](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/), [OpenHIP](https://open.hpi.de/), [Plus Acumen](https://www.plusacumen.org/), [USA Learns](https://www.usalearns.org/), [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship), [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

**Paywalled Courses** charge licensing fees in order to access materials. While we don’t allow for learning circles to charge learners to participate, oftentimes libraries and school systems will have existing contracts with these vendors, and in this case, it’s fine to run them as a learning circle. If you choose a course from a proprietary vendor, you’ll be able to run a learning circle with it but the course will not be visible to others on the P2PU course database. Examples: [GALE Courses](https://www.gale.com/c/gale-courses), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), and [Universal Class](https://library.universalclass.com/index.htm).

### Structure

While P2PU uses the term "courses" as shorthand for whatever is used in a learning circle , it's more precise to talk about learning materials. A course is a scaffolded learning experience, with distinct modules that often include explicit learning goals and estimated time for completion. This tends to be easier on the facilitator, as they need not do much to adapt the course to the group setting. That being said, many a learning circle have succeeded without the linear structure of an online course. This just requires a little more planning up front \(see adapt your course for more on this\).
