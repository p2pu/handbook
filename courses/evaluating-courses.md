# Evaluating Courses

Because the learning circle model is designed to support facilitators who aren't experts in the material, it can be tough to know how to choose the right course.&#x20;

For facilitators evaluating materials, here are a few key points to consider:

* **Open Access:** Far more than being free to use, open access [allows for the 5 R's](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/pathways/chapter/reading-the-5rs-of-oer/): retaining, reusing, revising, remixing, and redistributing. Open access allows for knowledge sharing and adapting in ways that simply isn't possible with proprietary courses, even if they are freely available. A [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) is a good sign!  Note: many free courses aren't always available: make sure it aligns with your schedule. (OER = [Open Educational Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open\_educational\_resources)).
* **Clear Prerequisites:** Even the most basic course has pre-requisites (time, literacy). Ensuring alignment between the stated goals of the course and what is expected beforehand is important.
* **No Additional Materials Required:** There's nothing more discouraging than beginning a course only to learn that there is an expectation that you have access to software or a book that aren't freely available to everyone in the learning circle.&#x20;
* **High Quality of Instruction:** Are the course materials and the platform intuitive to use? Who wrote the material? Where does it come from?&#x20;
* **Adaptability to learning circles**: Do the activities make sense being done together as group work? Is information shared in a linear format that will be easily adaptable to group study?&#x20;
* **Acceptable Workload:** Does the weekly time commitment and duration of the course align with your expectations? It's totally fine to decide that you'll only work through part of a course; just make sure you set a reasonable goal for participants.

P2PU's team moderates [learning resources](https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-resources/) on our website to make sure this content is open and freely available. We do our best to remove content that is unsuitable for a learning circle (such as for-profit trainings and advertisements) or that is otherwise in violation of [our values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/).

### Accessibility Considerations

Particularly when meeting online or in a space where digital resources can't be provided for participants, it's important to keep accessibility in mind when assessing learning materials:

* **Support for low bandwidth:** If your learners donâ€™t have reliable internet connections at home, courses with fewer videos and interactive elements might be more accessible.&#x20;
* **Mobile-friendly:** Many learners may not have a computer but can still participate via a smartphone or tablet. Fortunately, some course providers (including edX, FutureLearn, Coursera, and Udacity) offer mobile apps.
* **Digital literacy:** Will learners need guidance or tech support to navigate a course website on their own?&#x20;
* **Tool Requirements:** Consider the things your learners will need to complete a learning circle. Are there tools or materials they need to anticipate having access to?&#x20;
