# Evaluating Courses

You do not need to be an expert in the course material in order to facilitate a learning circle. However, whether you are looking on P2PU’s course database or elsewhere on the web, you’ll want to review the course before you create a learning circle. A few key points to consider when evaluating courses:

* Is the course free and do you expect that all resources will remain available for the duration of the learning circle? \(A [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) is a good sign!\)
* Is the course self-paced? If there is a set start and end date, does it align with your schedule?
* Does the weekly time commitment and duration of the course align with your expectations?
* Does the course require additional resources or software aside from a web browser and a word processor? If yes, do you have these resources available?

If you are struggling to choose between a few courses, P2PU has a [detailed rubric](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-to-look-for-in-a-course/2756) that you can use to evaluate and compare courses for learning circles.
