# Searching for Courses



Learning circle participants come together around a common interest, supported by freely accessible learning materials. As the facilitator, it is your job to identify these materials before the learning circle begins.

Most facilitators use online courses as the subject material for their learning circles because online courses are generally: \(1\) freely available \(2\) developed by subject matter experts, and \(3\) designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study. There are, however, many things that an online course cannot do. It cannot understand you as a person, it cannot make decisions for you, and it cannot tell you when you need to look elsewhere to find what you are looking for. Additionally, free online courses are a mixed bag: they aren’t always free, they aren’t always developed by experts, and the format doesn’t always support learning circles.

So for all of these reasons, we try to avoid looking for the “perfect course”: it simply does not exist! All we can do is try to find the best materials around to help your specific community of learners reach the goals that they have set out to achieve.

Don’t worry if you can’t find a course that you like on P2PU’s [course page](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/), because anybody with a P2PU account can add new courses to the P2PU database at any time using [this form](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/). Some of our favorite places to search for new courses are:

* [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses), a blog that stays up-to-date highlighting free online courses from around the web.
* [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/), a search tool that allows you to search for certain subjects by a number of different filters including start date and course rating.
* Of course, you can also simply search on Google or any other search engine for “free online course in \(whatever topic you want\)”.
* Finally, we keep a fairly up to date list of popular courses providers [on our website](https://github.com/p2pu/notes-on-edtech/blob/gh-pages/index.md). You can review this to find providers who you may not have heard of before





P2PU maintains a library of courses that have been successfully run as learning circles on our website. If you sort by popularity, you'll see some very popular courses that have been run in dozens of learning circles around the world. ‌

You are free, of course, to use any material that you want to run a learning circle. If you have a topic in mind but can’t find something on the P2PU courses page, try an aggregator or search engine that looks at courses across multiple platforms like [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses) or [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/). You can also simply search on Google or any other search engine for “free online course in \(whatever topic you want\)” or revisit the list of course providers included in Understanding Courses. 

The P2PU course library is a dynamic, community-powered place. So:‌

* If you find a good course that isn’t already on the P2PU courses page, [add it yourself](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/) so that other facilitators can easily find it in the future.
* If there is a topic that you're interested in but can't currently find a good course then [add it to this list](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-topics-are-missing/2786)!
* If you want to be so bold as to try and create your own course for learning circles, check out the section on [creating courses](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MXIxtjgfC1BFKKovPRs/course-creators/creating-courses-for-learning-circles).



**Open Courses:** [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Open Learning Initiative](https://oli.cmu.edu/), [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/). [OERu](https://oeru.org/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Saylor Academy](https://www.saylor.org/) and [Skills Commons](https://www.skillscommons.org/), [DigitalLearn](https://digitallearn.org/), [LumenLearning](https://lumenlearning.com/), [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) & [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/), [TechBoomers](https://techboomers.com/)

**Free Courses** may still grant unlimited access, but limit the extent to which course materials can be translated, adapted, or re-hosted without prior permission. There is the added risk that these materials become unavailable for certain periods of time, go behind a paywall, or go offline completely with no recourse. This comprises the largest chunk of learning circle materials. Examples: [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/),  [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Alison](https://alison.com/courses), [Canvas network](https://www.canvas.net/), [GCF Learn Free](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/), [OpenHIP](https://open.hpi.de/), [Plus Acumen](https://www.plusacumen.org/), [USA Learns](https://www.usalearns.org/), [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship), [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

**Paywalled Courses** charge licensing fees in order to access materials. While we don’t allow for learning circles to charge learners to participate, oftentimes libraries and school systems will have existing contracts with these vendors, and in this case, it’s fine to run them as a learning circle. If you choose a course from a proprietary vendor, you’ll be able to run a learning circle with it but the course will not be visible to others on the P2PU course database. Examples: [GALE Courses](https://www.gale.com/c/gale-courses), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), and [Universal Class](https://library.universalclass.com/index.htm).

When public access to library equipment, internet connection, and in-person support are a limited or unavailable option, it's important to keep in mind the types of access barriers your learners may have. As you’re assessing courses, here are some extra considerations for choosing the right material:

* Support for low bandwidth: If your learners don’t have reliable internet connections at home, courses with fewer videos and interactive elements might be more accessible. See [Supporting Limited Access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.8m2csx1lk7f)
* Mobile-friendly: Many learners may not have a computer but can still participate via a smartphone or tablet. Fortunately, some course providers \(including edX, FutureLearn, Coursera, and Udacity\) offer mobile apps.
* Digital literacy: Will learners need guidance or tech support to navigate a course website on their own? See [Facilitator Roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.2x96q46dtlgu)
* Tool Requirements: Consider the things your learners will need to complete a learning circle. Are there tools or materials they need to anticipate having access to? See [Pick Your Tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.2jjrsjmq2kky)
* Workload: It’s likely that the online course you choose was developed prior to the pandemic. Be prepared to only use a fraction of the online course and set achievable goals as everyone is learning in a much more demanding and complex environment. 

How to evaluate a course? 

**NO MAJOR LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS**

* Is the course free and do you expect that all resources will remain available? \(An open license like Creative Commons is a good sign!\)
* Is the course open-enrollment? If there is a set start and end date, does it align with your schedule?
* Does the weekly time commitment and duration of the course align with your expectations?
* Does the course require additional resources or software aside from a web browser and a word processor? If the answer is yes, do you have these resources available?

Some additional questions to consider when selecting a course:

**RELEVANCE TO EXPECTED LEARNERS**

* Is the subject matter interesting and relevant to the learners you anticipate working with?
* Are there prerequisites that will prevent many people from taking this course?
* Is the subject matter interesting for you to facilitate/study alongside learners?

**HIGH QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION**

* Does the mode of instruction seem engaging and effective?
* Are the course materials and the platform intuitive to use?
* Is there a clear sense of expertise present in the course materials?

**COHERENCE AS A LEARNING CIRCLE**

* Will learners easily be able to give feedback to one another given the content?
* Do the activities make sense being done together as group work?
* Can you clearly imagine your role facilitating this course in-person?

**OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEEDBACK**

* Do the assessments seem to reinforce course materials?
* Is there an active online community/access to mentors?
* Is there a clear way to get in touch with someone on the website if you run into technical difficulties?
