# Searching for Courses

If you can't find what you're looking for in P2PU's [course library](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/), try the sites below. If you find a good course that isn’t already on the P2PU courses page, [add it yourself](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/) so that other facilitators can easily find it in the future.

### ​Courses[​](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/)\*\*\*\*

**Open Access Courses:** [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [Open Learning Initiative](https://oli.cmu.edu/), [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/). [OERu](https://oeru.org/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Saylor Academy](https://www.saylor.org/) and [Skills Commons](https://www.skillscommons.org/), [DigitalLearn](https://digitallearn.org/), [LumenLearning](https://lumenlearning.com/), [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) & [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/), [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/), [TechBoomers](https://techboomers.com/)

**Free Courses:** [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Alison](https://alison.com/courses), [Canvas network](https://www.canvas.net/), [GCF Learn Free](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/), [OpenHIP](https://open.hpi.de/), [Plus Acumen](https://www.plusacumen.org/), [USA Learns](https://www.usalearns.org/), [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship), [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

**Paywalled Courses:** charge licensing fees in order to access materials. While we don’t allow for learning circles to charge learners to participate, oftentimes libraries and school systems will have existing contracts with these vendors, and in this case, it’s fine to run them as a learning circle. If you choose a course from a proprietary vendor, you’ll be able to run a learning circle with it but the course will not be visible to others on the P2PU course database. Examples: [GALE Courses](https://www.gale.com/c/gale-courses), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), and [Universal Class](https://library.universalclass.com/index.htm).

### **Non-Course Resources**

* **Free/Open Source Software:** [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) feature extensive tutorials and online communities.
* **Open Textbooks:** [African Minds](http://www.africanminds.co.za/), [BC Campus Open Ed](https://open.bccampus.ca/), [College of the Canyons](https://www.canyons.edu/Offices/DistanceLearning/OER/Pages/COC%20OER%20Textbooks.aspx), [LibreTexts](https://libretexts.org/), [Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/), and [Openstax](https://openstax.org/) are frequently publishing new textbooks that can be re-organized for learning circles.
* **Databases and Archives**: [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page), [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/), [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page)...even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Youtube](https://youtube.com/) can serve as the basis for learning circles in an endless array of topics.
* **Books:** [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) and [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) offer millions of books online for free; with a few well thought-out discussion prompts a book group can certainly be a learning circle.

### **Course/OER Search Tools**

* [Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses), a blog that stays up-to-date highlighting free online courses from around the web.
* [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/), a search tool that allows you to search for certain subjects by a number of different filters including start date and course rating.
* Of course, you can also simply search on Google or any other search engine for “free online course in \(whatever topic you want\)”.
* Finally, we keep a fairly up to date list of popular courses providers [on our website](https://github.com/p2pu/notes-on-edtech/blob/gh-pages/index.md). You can review this to find providers who you may not have heard of before
