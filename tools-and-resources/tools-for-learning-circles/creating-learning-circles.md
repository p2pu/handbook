# Creating Learning Circles

P2PU offers a free system for creating and managing learning circle meetings. Once you've created a P2PU account and decided what learning circle you want to run, you can create your learning circle and publish it to the world.

## Walkthrough: How to Create a Learning Circle

Creating a learning circle is a 5-step process:

1. **Select a Course:** Identify the learning materials you'll be using
2. **Find a Location:** Share the details of where you'll be meeting \(in person or online\)
3. **Select Meeting Dates:** Choose the dates and times of your meetings \(flexibly; you can update these later\)
4. **Customize the Sign-Up Page:** Write any details about your learning circle \(welcome message, materials needed, etc\) to customize the public sign-up page
5. **Finalize:** Privately reflect on your goals for the learning circle and optionally ask for help if you need it

### 1. Select a Course

### 2. Find a Location

### 3. Select Meeting Dates

### 4. Customize the Sign-Up Page

### 5. Finalize

Here, you have the option of answering two questions that will be shared with P2PU and a group of volunteer facilitators who we call the Welcome Committee.

* What do you hope to achieve by facilitating this learning circle?
* Is there anything that we can help you with as you get started?

### Publishing Your Learning Circle

Once you create a learning circle, we’ll automatically spin up a website for you to promote your learning circle. That will look something like this:

You’ll then receive a confirmation email which includes the link to your sign up page and a number of other resources \(including [promotional and outreach materials](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/promotion-and-outreach) and [a supplies checklist](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/creating-a-learning-circle)\). If you answered the questions in Step 5, the P2PU Welcome Committee will be copied on this email and someone will reach out to ensure that your concerns are addressed before the learning circle begins. You can manage your learning circle at any time [through your facilitator dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/).
