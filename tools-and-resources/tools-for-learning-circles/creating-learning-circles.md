# Creating learning circles

Once you have selected your course and confirmed where and when you’re going to meet, it’s time to create your learning circle on [the P2PU website](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/create/)!

The creation flow is a 5-step process; you can [click through it all](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/create/) without needing to log in to the P2PU site. The only thing worth calling out here in more detail is “Step 5: Finalize”. Here, you have the option of answering two questions that will be shared with P2PU and a group of volunteer facilitators who we call the Welcome Committee.

* What do you hope to achieve by facilitating this learning circle?
* Is there anything that we can help you with as you get started?

Once you create a learning circle, we’ll automatically spin up a website for you to promote your learning circle. That will look something like this:

You’ll then receive a confirmation email which includes the link to your sign up page and a number of other resources \(including [promotional and outreach materials](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/promotion-and-outreach) and [a supplies checklist](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/creating-a-learning-circle)\). If you answered the questions in Step 5, the P2PU Welcome Committee will be copied on this email and someone will reach out to ensure that your concerns are addressed before the learning circle begins.

You can manage your learning circle at any time [through your facilitator dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/). From there, you’ll be able to:

* Edit the learning circle description
* Toggle sign up on and off
* Edit the date and time of individual meetings
* View details of learners who have signed up
* Send emails or SMS messages to individual learners or the entire group
* Share weekly feedback with learners, your colleagues, and P2PU
