# Automated messaging

### Communication and feedback <a id="&#xFE0F;-communication-and-feedback"></a>

Feedback is an important part of peer learning, and P2PU’s tools help gather and share information between learners, facilitators, and the P2PU team across the learning circle. P2PU holds user privacy to the utmost importance and we are compliant with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\). Here is the type of communication that you can expect during a learning circle:

#### At sign up <a id="at-sign-up"></a>

When creating a learning circle, facilitators are prompted to state their goals for leading a learning circle and ask any questions or concerns they might have. Their responses are shared with a group of people that can assist a facilitator. Similarly, when learners sign up, they are asked what their goals are for joining a learning circle. They are then introduced to their facilitator in an email containing their answers to the signup questions.

#### During the learning circle <a id="during-the-learning-circle"></a>

Each week, a reminder message is automatically sent to learners two days beforehand via email or SMS. Before the reminder is sent, you have the opportunity to log into their dashboard and customize the message. After each weekly meeting, you can record a weekly reflection on their dashboard and send it to your learners and/or P2PU.

#### Upon completion <a id="upon-completion"></a>

At the end of a learning circle, learners and facilitators receive an email with a link to a survey that asks everyone to reflect upon the goal they first set, what worked well, what could be improved, and what their next steps will be.

The responses to the surveys are used to generate a summary of the learning circle, we call this the “learning circle insights” \([here is an example](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/923/report/)\). The learning circle insights are shared with the facilitator, any team organizers, and all the registered learners by email and is made public for other facilitators and learners to see.
