# Managing Learning Circles

Once you've [created a new learning circle](creating-learning-circles.md) \(either as a draft or live\), P2PU will automatically generate a sign-up page and a private management page associated with that learning circle. You will receive a confirmation email that contains links to both pages, and you can navigate to them manually on your Facilitator Dashboard.
