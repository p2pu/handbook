# Managing learning circles

Once you’ve saved your learning circle, it will appear on your Dashboard, where you can now access the learning circle management tools.

When you click on “Manage”, you’ll go to a page for your learning circle that looks like this:

#### Manage sign ups

Anytime that somebody signs up, they will appear on your dashboard. We recommend that all learners are signed up through the facilitator dashboard during the first meeting. If you need to add or remove learners from the learning circle, you can do so on the “Members” part of the dashboard.

To add a learner manually, click the “Add learner” button and fill in the learner detail. You will need to fill in the “Goal” and “Support” fields, so make sure that you get this information from the learners if you plan to add them to the dashboard at a later stage.![\_images/facilitator-dash-members.png](https://learning-circles-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/facilitator-dash-members.png)

#### View and edit meeting times

The dashboard will show you a list of all the meetings that are scheduled for you learning circle. Learners have the opportunity to RSVP to meeting reminders via emails they receive, and as they RSVP you will be able to see their responses here. If there are some meetings that will happen at a different time than normal, or if you would like to add an extra meeting, you can do so here.![\_images/facilitator-dash-meetings.png](https://learning-circles-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/facilitator-dash-meetings.png)

#### Contact learners

To send a new message to all learners, you can click on “New message”.![\_images/facilitator-dash-messages.png](https://learning-circles-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/facilitator-dash-messages.png)

Here you can author a message that will be sent out to everyone who signed up for the learning circle. The text you put in the “Email body” field will be sent to the learners who signed up with an email address, while the text in the “SMS body” field will be sent to the those who signed up with a mobile number. SMS text should be short \(limited to 160 characters\).![\_images/message-compose.png](https://learning-circles-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/message-compose.png)

Automatic reminders will be generated for learning circle meetings 4 days ahead of the meeting time. When this reminder is generated you will receive an email with an example of the reminder. If you wish to edit the content of the reminder, you can follow the link in this reminder or you can go to the dashboard and edit the reminder from there.
