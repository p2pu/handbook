# Community Support

Learning circles are built on open, equitable, and peer-based values. P2PU’s community of facilitators enact these values by [identifying](https://docs.p2pu.org/courses/set-your-intent#identifying-community-interests) their communities’ learning needs, using [free resources](https://docs.p2pu.org/courses/searching-for-courses) in their library/community spaces, developing their [co-learning](https://docs.p2pu.org/facilitation/facilitation-basics#becoming-a-co-learner) practice, and [meeting other facilitators](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/) who share these values.

P2PU supports facilitators in deepening the organic, collaborative, and supportive relationships that sustain this community of practice:

* We host [events](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/) each month for facilitators to ask questions and get support, and we host community events on topics chosen by P2PU’s [Team members](https://docs.p2pu.org/teams/about-teams).
* We gather facilitators’ feedback through [surveys and course ratings](https://docs.p2pu.org/facilitation/evaluate-and-reflect) to make sure your [insights](https://community.p2pu.org/t/learning-circle-insights-are-now-available/3056) can benefit every learning circle that follows.
* We offer a [forum](https://community.p2pu.org/) for facilitators to ask questions, share resources, discuss courses, and collaborate on issues as they arise.
* We maintain [facilitator guides](https://docs.p2pu.org/courses/facilitator-guides) that make facilitation easier for non-experts, and many of these guides are created and submitted by community members.

**Our community is built on facilitators’ participation, and our learning circles are stronger for it.** Help us strengthen our community! Attend an [event](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/), sign up for our [newsletter](https://p2pu.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f080ec78070523d59ef613eda\&id=06e9c4ece8), and share stories from your learning circle on[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/P2PU),[ Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p2puniversity/), and[ Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/P2PUniversity). #learningcircles
