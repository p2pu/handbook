# Collage & Image Credits

One of P2PU’s 4 core values is _open_: the belief that we create value not by gatekeeping but instead by working together, sharing resources, and lowering barriers to entry. P2PU is built on open source technology and everything we create is free to share, remix, and redistribute.

In that spirit of open, we use collage in our visuals, often paired with [images from our community](https://www.flickr.com/groups/p2pu/pool/), to diversify the imagery and imagination of the look and feel of P2PU.

For more details, check out our blog post. (_Coming soon!_)

## Make Your Own P2PU Collage

We've designed free templates in Figma and Google Slides for you to use to create promotional materials for your learning circles. Below we’ve shared a few of our favorite sources for open-access imagery to inspire your works\*.&#x20;

* [Smithsonian Open Access](https://www.si.edu/openaccess)
* [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main\_Page)
* [Library of Congress Free to Use](https://www.loc.gov/free-to-use/)
* [National Gallery of Art ](https://www.nga.gov/open-access-images.html)
* [WorldImages](https://worldimages.sjsu.edu)
* [Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org)

\*Many media archives in the United States disproportionately highlight the representation of wealthy white people in historical narratives. To counter this, P2PU makes a dedicated effort to find and use respectful depictions of people of color and women. We review the content of all materials we include in our collages (even when it’s obscured or illegible in the final piece) to avoid materials that contain violent, harmful, or otherwise disrespectful representations of human beings.
