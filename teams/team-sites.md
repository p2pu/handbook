# Custom Team Sites

Each team is set up with a unique learning circle landing page hosted on P2PU.org (_p2pu.org/your-team_) which includes an introduction to your learning circle program, a gallery of your facilitators, and a searchable list of your team's current and past learning circles. (See [Current Teams](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/#teams) for site examples)

All active learning circles happening across your team will automatically appear below the header, accompanied by an FAQ for learners.
