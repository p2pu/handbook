# Customizing team sites

Each team is set up with a unique learning circle landing page hosted on P2PU.org \(_p2pu.org/your-team_\) which includes an introduction to your learning circle program, a gallery of your facilitators, and a searchable list of your team's current and past learning circles. \(See [Current Teams](https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/) for site examples\)

All active learning circles happening across your team will automatically appear below the header, accompanied by an FAQ for learners.

### Editing Your Team Site

Organizers have the ability to edit most of the information on the team page directly from their dashboard by clicking "Edit Team Information" in the bottom right corner of the Team Management module. If you need to change the team name or URL you should email [support@p2pu.org](mailto:support%40p2pu.org).
