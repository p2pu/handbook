# Courses for Teams

### Curated Course Lists

Sometimes, teams want to limit the selection of courses that their facilitator community can choose from. So long as you've done your homework to ensure that the courses you're selecting are desirable for your community, this can be a good practice for a few reasons:

* Removes a step in the process for facilitators who are just getting started
* Allows the team to prioritize topics that align with other strategic goals
* Creates a shared space for facilitators to work together and share feedback on the same courses

This functionality will expanded in the coming months so that it can be handled directly from the organizer dashboard. For now, we do this by adding a tag to courses that you want to feature \([see Chicago's list](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/?languages=en&order&topics=cpl)\). You can add tags to courses that you add; if you want us to add a tag to an existing course in our library just reach out.

### Proprietary Course Management

P2PU is constantly moderating the list of online courses available at [https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/). One of our goals with course moderation is to ensure that facilitators never encounter a course that they cannot freely access. In addition to deleting courses outright, we will flag a course as “proprietary” if it comes from a pay-to-play vendor like Lynda or GALE. These courses will no longer appear on the public course page search, but they _will_ continue to appear for logged in users who are on the same team as the person who added the course, the assumption being that team members have access to the same proprietary materials.
