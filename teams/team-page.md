# Team Page

Each team has a unique learning circle landing page \(p2pu.org/\[your-team\]\) where all of your learning circles will appear in a single place. Many teams use this single URL for all learning circle promotion. Since past learning circles are also visible on a separate tab, this page is also a useful resource for talking about learning circles with colleagues and seeing what courses have been facilitated by your team in the past.

The top half of the page features basic information about your team, including a header image, your logo, intro text, contact information, and a gallery of facilitators.

Below that, you will find sign up pages for all learning circles affiliated with your team, accompanied by an FAQ page geared towards potential learning circle participants.

### Editing Your Team Page

Most everything on the team page can be editing in realtime by clicking  ‘edit team information’ from an organizer's dashboard. If you need to change the team name or URL you should reach out to P2PU.

Additionally, updating profile photos and adding new facilitators can be done without P2PU, but won't be immediately visible on the site. Generally, these changes update weekly but you can email [support@p2pu.org](mailto:support%40p2pu.org) if you need these updates visible sooner.
