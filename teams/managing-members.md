# Managing Members

## Adding Team Members

There are three ways for an organizer to invite somebody to a team, all of which can be accessed from the Team Management block on the dashboard.

### Option 1: Automatically through email domain

If your team is associated with an organization that has its own email domain, P2PU can save the email domain in your team settings so that any new facilitator with a validated matching email address will automatically receive an invitation to join your team. For example, if your team members all have staff emails such as _sharon@bigpubliclibrary.org_, you can set _bigpubliclibrary.org_ as your team domain so that when _nico@bigpubliclibrary.org_ registers on the P2PU platform, they’ll be automatically invited to join.

### Option 2: Email invitation

You can send invitations directly via email from your dashboard. If the recipient already has a P2PU account, they will be prompted to join your team. If they do not, they will be asked to create a P2PU account and then prompted to join your team.

### Option 3: Invitation link

You can also generate a unique link that allows anyone with the link to join your team. You can regenerate this link whenever you want, making all previous links inactive.

### **Pending Invitations**

Invitations that have been sent via Option 1 or Option 2 will be visible in the “pending invitations” tab until the user accepts or rejects the invitation.

## Removing Team Members

There isn't currently a way for organizers to remove a facilitator from a team or change a team members status between facilitator and organizer. If you'd like to make any of these changes contact  [support@p2pu.org](mailto:support%40p2pu.org). 

## Facilitator Profiles

All P2PU accountholders can update their profiles through [account settings](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/settings/%29). In addition to appearing on learning circle sign up pages, their avatar will also appear on the team page carousel. Team members who have uploaded a photo will appear first, followed by others with a placeholder image \(example below\). Organizers should encourage facilitators to add an image so that they can be fully featured on their team site!
