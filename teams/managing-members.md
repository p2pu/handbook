# Managing Team Members

Adding a facilitator to your team will enable a variety functions:

* Their P2PU profile image and any learning circle they create will show up on your team page
* Their learning circle sign up pages will list an affiliation with your team and a link back to your team page
* They will see details about all learning circles happening on the team on their dashboard, and they'll have the option to opt into weekly team summary emails
* They will be able to create learning circles using any proprietary courses that have been added to the P2PU courses page by their team members

### Adding Team Members

Once your P2PU account is set up as an organizer, you will see a new block on your learning circle dashboard called _Team Management_, where you can view and invite members to your team.

‌There are three ways to invite people to join your team:

1. **Automatically through email domain:** If your team is associated with an organization that has its own email domain, P2PU can save the email domain in your team settings so that any new facilitator with a validated matching email address will automatically receive an invitation to join your team. For example, if your team members all have staff emails such as _sharon@bigpubliclibrary.org_, you can set _bigpubliclibrary.org_ as your team domain so that when _nico@bigpubliclibrary.org_ registers on the P2PU platform, they’ll be automatically invited to join.
2. **Email invitation**: You can send invitations directly via email from your dashboard. If the recipient already has a P2PU account, they will be prompted to join your team. If they do not, they will be asked to create a P2PU account and then prompted to join your team.
3. **Invitation link:** You can also generate a unique link that allows anyone with the link to join your team. You can regenerate this link whenever you want, making all previous links inactive.

### **Pending Invitations**

Invitations that have been sent via Option 1 or Option 2 will be visible in the “pending invitations” tab until the user accepts or rejects the invitation.

### Removing Team Members

There isn't currently a way for organizers to remove a facilitator from a team or change a team members status between facilitator and organizer. If you'd like to make any of these changes contact  [support@p2pu.org](mailto:support%40p2pu.org). 

### Facilitator Profiles

All P2PU accountholders can update their profiles through [account settings](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/settings/%29). In addition to appearing on learning circle sign up pages, their avatar will also appear on the team page carousel. Team members who have uploaded a photo will appear first, followed by others with a placeholder image \(example below\). Organizers should encourage facilitators to add an image so that they can be fully featured on their team site!
