### Adding a co-facilitator

[Co-facilitation](https://docs.p2pu.org/facilitation/facilitation-basics#working-with-a-co-facilitator) is a great way to share facilitation responsibilities with colleagues. Teams members have the added benefit of adding co-facilitators to their learning circles. This function provides equal permissions to all co-facilitators to edit the learning circle, delete the learning circle, and receive all learners' messages. Facilitators will receive a single survey at the end of their learning circle, and we recommend that co-facilitators collaborate to share their insights.

Teams members can add a co-facilitator during the final step of the learning circle creation process. You can edit your learning circle to add or remove co-facilitators at any time. Once added to the learning circle, all facilitators' avatars will be featured on the learning circle signup page.
