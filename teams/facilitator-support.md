# Facilitator Support

P2PU offers additional support to Teams members, including members-only learning circles, staff onboarding sessions, and other professional development opportunities.&#x20;

Teams members can make a one-on-one appointment with our Partnerships Lead, Q Goss, by visiting the dashboard.

Facilitators can also get help by emailing us at thepeople@p2pu.org, filling out our [contact form](https://www.p2pu.org/en/help/) on the website, and attending our [public monthly facilitator calls](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/).
