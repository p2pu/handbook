# Aggregated data

There are five types of data that are gathered during a learning circle, all of which is aggregated and shared with facilitators when the learning circle is completed.

* Information about the learning circle (gathered when created by the facilitator)
* Sign up info (input by learners)
* Weekly reflections (from facilitator)
* End of learning circle survey (from learners)
* End of learning circle survey (from facilitators)

Data for multiple learning circles across a single team is currently available upon request.&#x20;
