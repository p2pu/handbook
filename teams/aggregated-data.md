# Aggregated Data

There are five types of data that are gathered during a learning circle, all of which is aggregated and shared with facilitators when the learning circle is completed.

* Information about the learning circle \(when created by facilitator\)
* Sign up info \(input by learners\)
* Weekly reflections \(facilitator\)
* End of learning circle survey \(learners\)
* End of learning circle survey \(facilitators\)

Data for multiple learning circles across a single team is currently available upon request.
