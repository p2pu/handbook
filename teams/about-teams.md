# About Teams

P2PU offers additional functionality for institutions that are running learning circles across multiple locations or with a network of multiple facilitators. Each P2PU Team is led by an _organizer_ who works closely with P2PU to ensure that facilitators in their area have everything they need to run learning circles.‌

Teams are granted the following features and functionality, as detailed throughout this section:

* Customizable learning circle team website (see [Current Teams](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/#teams))
* Weekly internal email with team updates and reflections
* Curated course lists and proprietary course management
* Added co-facilitator functionality
* Aggregated learning circle feedback and data
* Organizer-level team management tools
* Prioritized support from P2PU staff
* Access to a variety of P2PU-led learning circles and trainings
