# Teams

We offer additional functionality for institutions that are running learning circles across multiple locations \(“teams”\). Each team is led by an organizer, who works closely with P2PU to ensure that new facilitators in their area have everything they need to run learning circles. Teams are granted the following features and functionality:

* Customizable learning circle team website
* Weekly email with team updates
* Proprietary course management
* Aggregated learning circle feedback and data

Teams also get additional support from P2PU -- access to trainings, PD, new courses, facilitation help, case studies, and orientation for new facilitators.  Build a community

Current learning circle teams are visible at [https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/). If you would like to start a new team, read on and reach out.
