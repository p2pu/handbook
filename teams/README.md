# Teams

We offer additional functionality for institutions that are running learning circles across multiple locations \(“teams”\). Each team is led by an organizer, who works closely with P2PU to ensure that new facilitators in their area have everything they need to run learning circles. Teams are granted the following features and functionality:

* Customizable learning circle team website
* Team profiles featured on the P2PU site
* Weekly email with team updates
* Proprietary course management
* Aggregated learning circle feedback and data



Adding a facilitator to a team will enable a variety functions:

* Any learning circle they create will show up on your team page
* Sign up pages for their learning circles will mention and link back to your team page
* Their P2PU avatar will be added to the photo carousel on your team page
* They will have the option to opt into weekly summary emails
* A new block will appear on their dashboard highlighting upcoming learning circles across their team
* They will gain access to any proprietary courses that have been added by their team members

Teams also get additional support from P2PU -- access to trainings, PD, new courses, facilitation help, case studies, and orientation for new facilitators.  Build a community

Current learning circle teams are visible at [https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/). If you would like to start a new team, read on and reach out.
