# Gather a Team

## Generate interest and buy-in

If you don’t have support or buy-in from those who make decisions, your program might not succeed! Especially for larger institutions like libraries, buy-in from management is important. So, how do you get these leaders interested? 

When learning circles were introduced in Kenya, Juliana worked to understand the goals and opportunities of the learning circle program, and then framed P2PU to her colleagues in language that they understood. This meant looking through P2PU resources, and understanding how the program could reinforce the goals and strategic plan of the library. 

KNLS had recently started an initiative to increase the digital skills of library staff, so emphasizing the online component of learning circles seemed like a good place to start. Next, Juliana was intrigued that P2PU relied on free, online learning resources. KNLS has limited funding to spend on licensed content, so reinforcing the sustainability of the program \(due to no subscription costs\) was very important for her colleagues. Finally, KNLS has a mandate to work with community organizations outside of the library system. Juliana felt that the social nature of learning circles could help reinforce this goal, as early meetings with librarians and patrons revealed that many students were interested in taking learning circles to complement formal education programs.

 So, when it came to pitching learning circles to her organization, Juliana described the program as something that would improve the ICT skills of library professionals while simultaneously bringing the library closer to other community organizations without large software licensing expenses.

As you set out to build a coalition in your organization, read through the [testimonials section](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/testimony) of our community forum to understand how learning circles have worked for other organizations, and note anything that resonates with you. Then, take a look at your latest organizational strategy or plan and utilize that language when speaking with your colleagues about starting a learning circle program.  


## Find the right people and places

You’ll need to start by finding the right people with the right skills that work in locations that are a good fit. These first facilitators, once experienced, should be prepared to train their colleagues in order to share their knowledge within your organization. 

Juliana looked out for a few key qualities when finding her first facilitators: interest in embracing new services and initiatives, capacity to create awareness within KNLS, and a commitment to serving their community. Juliana did not specifically require a significant level of technological expertise for initial facilitators, as she felt that this could alienate potential strong facilitators.  

In addition to people, sites matter too. Juliana recommends assessing site locations for their equipment and capacity to host learning circles. Consider, too, asking about each site’s existing programs. In the best case, you might find a site with experienced and eager staff with an existing learning or education program that might benefit from the integration of learning circles. It might also be interesting to choose sites that have common programming interests such as digital literacy and employment support so that sites can cross-promote and problem-solve issues together.

Juliana chose four library staff from two different library sites \(Nairobi Buruburu and Nakuru\) for the pilot due their locations and infrastructural development. Buruburu Library is in Nairobi, with a large population of youth seeking to advance their education. Nakuru library is located in a town with many university satellite campuses. Many students in Nakuru are from rural areas and they spend most of their free time in the library. Buruburu and Nakuru also had the potential to host future regional meetings, which was important for reinforcing the grassroots nature of learning circle expansion.  


## Reach out to potential facilitators

We think that reaching out to 4-12 people is a good way to start \(it’s not a coincidence that that is the same size we recommend for learning circles!\) We have a variety of resources available to help you explain learning circles to your colleagues. Check out each of these before you reach out:

Hi there,

I’m working with Peer 2 Peer University, a non-profit organization that runs free, non-formal learning programs, to try and start something in our community. 

P2PU created learning circles: study groups for people who meet in public spaces like libraries to learn something together, using free online courses and peer learning practices. Learning circles are a proven and cost-effective learning model for accessing high-quality course materials free of charge. By bringing people to the library to take online courses together, learning circles build library capacity as community learning hubs, improve the professional skills of library staff, and provide empowering educational experiences for library users. 

Learning circles are free to join and free to create. [Here's a short video](https://youtu.be/bQqmIS7WQa8) that explains the program. You can also visit their website at [p2pu.org](http://p2pu.org/) to learn more about this idea. At this point, I’m looking for a few volunteers to help us pilot a program here. If you’re interested, please fill out this quick form and we can schedule a date to meet: [bit.ly/p2puteam](http://bit.ly/p2puteam)
