**Learning circles** are free, lightly-facilitated study groups that meet regularly to learn from open educational resources. 

Rooted in values of community, peer learning, equity, and open access, a learning circle typically has the following components: 

* **a facilitator** \(responsible for organizing the learning circle, not teaching: the group should work together to understand the material; see [**Facilitating Peer Learning**](facilitation/facilitation-basics.md)\)
* **a group of learners** \(ideally 4–12 for an engaging group dynamic; see [**Finding Participants**](facilitation/finding-participants.md)\)
* **a regular meeting space** \(in-person or online; see [**Setting Up Meeting Spaces**](facilitation/set-up-your-space.md)\)
* **recurring meetings** \(90 minutes/week for 6–8 weeks is a sweet spot for building a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment; see [**Meeting Structure**](methodology/learning-circle-structure.md)\)
* **dedicated learning materials** \(often an online course; see [**Choosing a Course**](courses/choosing-courses.md)\)
