# Learning Circles Handbook

Learning circles are groups of people who meet to learn something new together. Rooted in the [P2PU organizational values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/) of community, peer learning, and equity, each learning circle has a regular meeting space \(in-person or online\), a dedicated learning resource \(like an online course\), a facilitator \(who need not be a content expert\), and, of course, a group of learners \(we find that 5-12 often works well\).

This handbook is a comprehensive resource all about learning circles: how they work, how to start one, and how to enjoy the process! In addition to resources for facilitators, you'll also find section for course creators and organizers who want to start learning circles in their community.

Like the learning circle tools and community, this handbook is freely available to everyone. In exchange, we ask that you not charge learners any money to attend a learning circle or access course materials.
