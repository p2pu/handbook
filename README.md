# Learning Circles Handbook

Learning circles are groups of people who gather to learn something together. Rooted in the [P2PU organizational values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/) of community, peer learning, equity, and open, each learning circle typically has a regular meeting space \(in-person or online\), a dedicated learning resource \(like an online course\), a facilitator \(who need not be a subject expert\), and a group of learners.

This handbook is a comprehensive resource all about learning circles: how they work, how to start one, and how to enjoy the process! Much of the handbook is written for facilitators, but you'll also find section for [course creators](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYpgYt91w-nYyctNlLj/courses/creating-courses) and o[rganizers](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYpgYt91w-nYyctNlLj/teams) looking to start learning circles in their community.
