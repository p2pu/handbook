# Learning Circle Handbook

![](.gitbook/assets/learningcircle-crop.png)

**Learning circles** are free, lightly-facilitated study groups that meet regularly to learn from open educational resources. Rooted in values of community, peer learning, equity, and open access, a learning circle typically has four components: 

* **a facilitator** who organizes the learning circle and keeps the group on task but doesn't need to be an expert in the topic
* **a group of learners** \(ideally 4–12\)
* **a regular meeting space and time** \(in-person or online; 90 minutes/week for 6–8 seems to be the sweet spot that offers enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment\)
* **dedicated learning resource** \(like an online course\) 

**Meeting structure:** To help facilitators avoid feeling like they need to be setting teaching plans, we recommend a basic and flexible weekly structure of a check-in, time spent learning, an optional break \(or energizing activity\), and a closing reflection.
