# Learning Circle Handbook

![](.gitbook/assets/lc-formula.png)

**Learning circles** are free peer-based study groups powered by open educational resources. 

This handbook is a comprehensive resource all about learning circles: how they work, how to start one, and how to enjoy the process! Much of the handbook is written for facilitators, but you'll also find section for [course creators](courses/creating-courses.md) and [organizers](teams/) looking to start learning circles in their community.

Rooted in [P2PU's organizational values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/) of community, peer learning, equity, and open, each learning circle typically has a regular meeting space \(in-person or online\), a dedicated learning resource \(like an online course\), a facilitator \(who need not be a subject expert\), and a group of learners.

* **4-12 Learners**: Less than 4 people can start to feel too interpersonal. More than 12 can make it difficult to connect as a group. 
* **90 Minutes for 6-8 Weeks:** This has emerged as a sweet spot, offering enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment. 
* **Meeting structure:** To help facilitators avoid feeling like they need to be setting teaching plans, we recommend a basic and flexible weekly structure of a check-in, time spent learning, an optional break \(or energizing activity\), and a closing reflection.
