# Learning Circle Handbook

Learning circles are groups of people who gather to learn something together. Rooted in [P2PU's organizational values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/) of community, peer learning, equity, and open, each learning circle typically has a regular meeting space \(in-person or online\), a dedicated learning resource \(like an online course\), a facilitator \(who need not be a subject expert\), and a group of learners.

This handbook is a comprehensive resource all about learning circles: how they work, how to start one, and how to enjoy the process! Much of the handbook is written for facilitators, but you'll also find section for [course creators](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYpgYt91w-nYyctNlLj/courses/creating-courses) and [organizers](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYpgYt91w-nYyctNlLj/teams) looking to start learning circles in their community.

### Why Learning Circles?

P2PU champions learning circles because they are an equalizer, combining the flexibility and scale of online courses with the support and context of in-person learning communities. Since learning circles started at Chicago Public Library in 2015, we’ve found that learning circles:

* Lead to retention rates 10x higher than online courses alone
* Increase people’s agency as self-guided learners
* Increase people’s ability to set and achieve their own learning goals
* Invigorate community-based learning in libraries and education centers
* Create viable alternatives to formal education
* Support digital inclusion for people new to online learning
