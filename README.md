# Learning Circles Handbook

Learning circles are groups of people who gather to learn something together. Rooted in the [P2PU organizational values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about/) of community, peer learning, and equity, each learning circle typically has a regular meeting space \(in-person or online\), a dedicated learning resource \(like an online course\), a facilitator \(who need not be a subject expert\), and a group of learners.

This handbook is a comprehensive resource all about learning circles: how they work, how to start one, and how to enjoy the process! Much of the handbook is written for facilitators, but you'll also find section for course creators and organizers looking to start learning circles in their community.
