# Organizers & Teams

P2PU offers additional tools and functionality for **organizers:** those who want to organize a **team** of learning circle facilitators in one or more locations. We work closely with organizers to ensure that new facilitators in their area have everything they need to run learning circles.

## What does an organizer look like?

**Organizers** are responsible for coordinating teams, which are networks of learning circles happening across a single city or region. Organizers work closely with P2PU to ensure that new facilitators in their area have everything they need to run learning circles, while also representing their hometown and contributing local insights as part of the P2PU community.

**Who else is an organizer, exactly?**

There are around twenty organizers so far \(with twenty teams!\) and weâ€™re eager to keep this number growing. One of our first organizers was Kate Lapinski, the Learning & Economic Advancement at the Chicago Public Library. Kate has been training and supporting a large number of branches and librarians to run learning circles since learning circles started in 2015. Another well-known organizer is Juliana Muchai, Principal Resource Mobilization Officer for the Kenya National Library Service. Juliana has grown learning circles from a couple in Nairobi to being a regularly run program found in 15 public library branches across Kenya.

## Tools for Organizers

Organizers get set up with a custom set of software tools to help them coordinate learning circles. Teams are granted the following features and functionality:

* **A custom URL for your team** that features all your teamâ€™s active or upcoming learning circles in one place which you can share with anyone
* **Weekly updates from your team of facilitators** that include the number of learner sign-ups from each learning circle, a weekly team schedule as well as a summary of facilitator feedback.
* **Learning circle reports** that show insights from your aggregated reports over time

Additionally, there are non-technical supports for organizers found in this Forum which include [training resources 3](https://community.p2pu.org/tags/training) such as detailed agendas, slide decks, and videos; [promotional templates 2](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/promotion-and-outreach) and [feedback and testimonials](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/testimony) from other team organizers across the world.
