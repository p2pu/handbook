# ðŸš§ Start a Team

Teams are regional networks of learning circles led by a local organizer and supported by P2PU. If you have a facilitator account, you can apply to join an existing team through [your dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/). If youâ€™d like to launch a new team in your area, you can start by reviewing [our organizer materials](https://www.p2pu.org/en/organize/).
