# Teams

We offer additional functionality for institutions that are running learning circles across multiple locations \(“teams”\). Each team is led by an organizer, who works closely with P2PU to ensure that new facilitators in their area have everything they need to run learning circles. Teams are granted the following features and functionality:

* Customizable learning circle team website
* Team profiles featured on the P2PU site
* Weekly email with team updates
* Proprietary course management
* Aggregated learning circle feedback and data

Teams also get additional support from P2PU -- access to trainings, PD, new courses, facilitation help, case studies, and orientation for new facilitators. 

Current learning circle teams are visible at [https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/teams/). If you would like to start a new team, read on and reach out.

## Team Management Table

Once you are set up as an organizer, you will see a new block on your learning circle dashboard called Team Management, where you can view and invite members to your team. There are three ways to invite people to join your team:

#### Option 1: Automatically through email domain

If your team is associated with an organization that has its own email domain, P2PU can save the email domain in your team settings so that any new facilitator with a validated matching email address will automatically receive an invitation to join your team. For example, if your team members all have staff emails such as _sharon@bigpubliclibrary.org_, you can set _bigpubliclibrary.org_ as your team domain so that when _nico@bigpubliclibrary.org_ registers on the P2PU platform, they’ll be automatically invited to join.

#### Option 2: Email invitation

You can send invitations directly via email from your dashboard. If the recipient already has a P2PU account, they will be prompted to join your team. If they do not, they will be asked to create a P2PU account and then prompted to join your team.

#### Option 3: Invitation link

You can also generate a unique link that allows anyone with the link to join your team. You can regenerate this link whenever you want, making all previous links inactive.

**Pending Invitations**

Invitations that have been sent via Option 1 or Option 2 will be visible in the “pending invitations” tab until the user accepts or rejects the invitation.

## Team Sites

Each team has a unique learning circle landing page \(p2pu.org/\[your-team\]\), which starts with an introduction to your learning circle program and a gallery of your facilitators. Organizers can edit the header image, logo, intro text, and contact information directly from the dashboard by clicking ‘edit team information’. These changes will appear immediately.

All active learning circles happening across your team will automatically appear below the header, accompanied by an FAQ for learners.

There are still a few changes to team invitations and team sites that P2PU has to make manually. Those include:

* Changing the team name or the desired URL of a team
* Removing facilitators from a team
* Changing a team member's status between facilitator and organizer

Additionally, updating profile photos and adding new facilitators can be done without P2PU, but won't be immediately visible on the site. Generally, these changes update weekly but you can email [support@p2pu.org](mailto:support%40p2pu.org) if you need these updates visible sooner.

## Weekly Team Email Updates

Team organizers receive a weekly update every Monday. This update contains information about past, present, and upcoming learning circle meetings on your team, including learning circle reports, weekly feedback from facilitators, and information about who is signing up. Facilitators can opt into receiving this weekly update through their account settings.

### Proprietary Course Management

P2PU is constantly moderating the list of online courses available at [https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/courses/). One of our goals with course moderation is to ensure that facilitators never encounter a course that they cannot freely access. In addition to deleting courses outright, we will flag a course as “proprietary” if it comes from a pay-to-play vendor like Lynda or GALE. These courses will no longer appear on the public course page search, but they _will_ continue to appear for logged in users who are on the same team as the person who added the course \(the assumption being that team members have access to the same proprietary materials\).
