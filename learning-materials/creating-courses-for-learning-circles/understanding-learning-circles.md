# Understanding Learning Circles

P2PU champions learning circles because they are an equalizer. Traditional higher education programs can reinforce inequality by creating barriers to access to the people who stand to benefit the most. Online education, while wide-reaching and often free, is still inaccessible to many people and can be intimidating, lonely, or ineffective once you’ve gained access. Learning circles are designed to help people find a supportive environment to learn about a topic they care about, while developing relationships with members of their community along the way. 

Since starting the program in 2015, we’ve found that learning circles:

* Lead to retention rates 10x higher than online courses alone
* Increase people’s agency as self-guided learners
* Increase people’s ability to set and achieve their own learning goals
* Invigorate community-based learning in libraries and education centers
* Create viable alternatives to formal education
* Support digital inclusion for people new to online learning

### How they work

A learning circle typically has a facilitator to guide the group \(who needn’t be an expert in the subject\), a guiding source of knowledge \(often a free online course or other accessible learning resource\), a group of learners who meet regularly, and a dedicated meeting room \(usually at a public space such as a library, or community center; but recently online\).

Learning circles meet regularly, often 90 minutes/week for 6-8 weeks. Though the schedule is flexible based on a group’s needs, this seems to be a sweet spot that offers enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment.  


Despite variations in practice, there are five traits that every learning circle should have:

* **Free:** No cost to attend or access the learning materials
* **Recurring:** Multiple meetings allow for building relationships between learners and reinforcing knowledge over time
* **Structured:** Follows a reliable weekly process \(typically a check-in, reading/watching, activities, and reflection\)
* **Facilitated:** Gently guided but not taught—with a little practice and training, anyone should be able to facilitate! 
* **Collaborative:** Scheduled discussions and activities that engage the entire group

### Learning circle structure

Learning circle meetings typically follow a 4-part structure—intro, learning, activity, reflection—that creates ample space for empowering individual learning goals, building group relationships, and supporting the facilitator. This can be a helpful baseline for organizing knowledge into a learner-friendly format. 

#### Check-In

Starting and finishing each meeting as a group is a core component of learning circles. A consistent check-in time warms up group conversation and is a reliable way to build community with icebreakers, recap previous sessions, and set expectations for the meeting. 

#### Read & Watch

Read & Watch refers to the time spent with the learning content and is where most of the expert knowledge lives. This can take many forms, from an article or a textbook chapter, to a playlist of videos, to a hybrid format of interactive content. Once you’ve outlined the major sections of your course, you’ll probably first want to start populating this section: what information do you want to express in this module and what content medium \(reading, video, etc.\) is going to best express it?

#### Do/Make/Say/Think

While Read & Watch can sometimes be passive, Do/Make/Say/Think is its active counterpart. \(These can also be interspersed throughout a meeting.\) D/M/S/T refers to a hands-on group project or discussion to solidify what people have just read or watched. Sometimes these activities come easily \(e.g. if the topic is public speaking, learners can take turns sharing short monologues\), and sometimes they require some creativity to effectively reinforce the goals of the module. 

#### Reflection

A planned closing space helps the group collectively consider what was covered during the meeting and provide feedback to guide their experience moving forward. As a baseline, we often recommend using a Plus/Delta: each participant shares a plus \(something that went well\) and a delta \(something they’d like to change for the next meeting\). These contributions can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting.
