# Creating Courses for Learning Circles

This section is designed to help you design and create an online course for learning circles. Whether you are a subject matter expert or a motivated hobbyist, we believe that you can assemble high-quality learning materials that can be shared with learning communities around the world. Along the way, you’ll also:

* **Learn new skills:** Creating a course is a great way to practice and refine a number of skills, including learning design and web development.
* **Participate in our community:** Course creators are invited to join our community and stay up to date on how their course is being used around the world.
* **Contribute to an OER ecosystem:** By developing an open educational resource, you’re contributing to an equitable process of knowledge sharing. 

You'll find here the five steps involved in the course creation process:

1. [Understand Learning Circles](understand-learning-circles.md)
2. [Establish Goals & Outcomes](establish-goals-and-outcomes.md)
3. [Develop Course Content](develop-course-content.md)
4. [Publish Your Course](publish-your-course.md)
5. [Finish and Share](finish-and-share.md)
