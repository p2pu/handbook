## Online Course Providers

Organizations who develop content that people have used for learning circles in the past, distinguished by license. Our baseline rule for learning circles is that participants should never have to pay anything to attend, however our long-term vision is that learning circles serve to improve open online learning resources, rather than help institutions justify paying license fees to proprietary vendors.

### Open

Course developers that reliably opt for Creative Commons or equivalent open license.

* [DigitalLearn](https://digitallearn.org/)
* [LumenLearning](https://lumenlearning.com/)
* [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
* [Saylor Academy](https://www.saylor.org/)

* [Skills Commons](https://www.skillscommons.org/)
* [TechBoomers](https://techboomers.com/)
* [Wisc-Online](https://www.wisc-online.com/)

### Free

Course developers who generally retain copyright, but offer a useable portion of course materials for free.

* [Alison](https://alison.com/courses)
* [Canvas network](https://www.canvas.net/)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

* [USA Learns](https://www.usalearns.org/)
* [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship)
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

### Paid

Course developers who charge for access to courses, and whose fees \(in the context of learning circles\) are generally covered by an institution-wide license at a public library system.

* [GALE Courses](https://www.gale.com/c/gale-courses)
* [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/)
* [Tech Change](https://www.techchange.org/)
* [Universal Class](https://library.universalclass.com/index.htm)

## Non-Course OER Resources  <a id="good-oer-resources-not-structured-as-online-courses"></a>

These organizations and initiatives develop openly licensed content that is not compiled as an online course \(e.g. database, open textbook\). Since learning circle facilitators are not expected to be content experts, we need to ensure that materials are presented in a format that works well for learning circles: 6-8 weeks of 2 hour meetings in small, face-to-face study groups.
