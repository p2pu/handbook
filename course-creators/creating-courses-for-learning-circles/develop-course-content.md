# Develop Course Content

Once you’ve established the goals for a course, outline 2–3 learning goals for each individual meeting and begin arranging course materials into the learning circle framework. When scoping out the learning materials, keep in mind the 6-8 week length of learning circle: we tend to think about the learning content as being more than a workshop, but less than a semester’s worth of work.

### Course intro

Your course should have a landing page, which outlines basic expectations for the course. In addition to the title, here are a few things you could include:

* Who you are and why you created the course
* Major learning objectives for the course
* Expected pacing for working through the material
* Any needed prerequisites or expectations for participants
* Supplemental resources to help a facilitator prepare

### Principles for learning design

Building on the four-part meeting structure outlined earlier, there are some principles for learning design that we think work well for learning circles.  


* **Project-based &gt; theoretical:** Learning circles work well when participants are working towards a shared goal. Frame your learning circle more towards “Learn to Write Fiction” than “Composition 101”; more towards “Build a website” than “Intro to HTML/CSS”.
* **Personal &gt; “objective”:** You are human! Be clear about your expertise, perspective, and motivation in creating this course. Own your expertise, and don’t try and hide behind the cloak of objectivity. 
* **Group discussion &gt; user interaction:** Rely on the relationships formed in the learning circle rather than overbuilding interactivity into the course. Personal exploration comes through discussion questions, not quizzes.
* **Clear &gt; complicated:** Don’t use jargon or complex language when something simple will do. We like to run copy through the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) and target a Grade 8-10 reading level.
* **Quality &gt; quantity:** Where possible, provide a variety of forms of engagement. We like to mix up text, videos, downloadable handouts/exercises, and linking out to interactive tools and resources.
* **Further exploration &gt; homework:** Ideally, learners can have a successful learning circle experience without doing any homework outside of the meetings. That being said, your course doesn’t need to be an end-all-be-all: feel free to include opportunities for further work.
* **Self/peer evaluation &gt; exams:** Think about assessment as an opportunity for personal and group reflection, rather than a test that needs to be passed.
* **Transparency &gt; hierarchy:** Generally, a facilitator shouldn’t need a separate facilitation guide in order to run a learning circle. When thinking about the voice that you use, imagine a group working through the materials together, rather than a teacher imparting knowledge to a classroom.
* **Connected &gt; silo:** Don’t feel like you need to present yourself as the single authority on the subject: Helping people find what they’re looking for is more important than increasing course retention.
* **Open &gt; Closed:** We license course materials with a [Creative Commons BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) license, which means that anybody can reuse or remix our content so long as they attribute us \(BY\) and share their derivative work with the same license \(SA=Share Alike\).

### Finding additional content

We encourage course creators to consider broadening the perspectives in their materials by referencing or including external content, as long as it can be done appropriately and will full credit to the original sources. Some practices for identifying usable external content: 

* **Quotes and Ideas:** Standard citations rules apply when creating online courses. The [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html) is an exceptional resource for making sure you’re citing things accurately.
* **News Articles:** Linking directly to news articles is a great way to bring in outside opinions and connect your course to current events. Consider using the Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) or [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) to prevent link rot, and be mindful about not linking to articles with paywalls.
* **Images and Icons:** Reuse images and icons from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), [unDraw](https://undraw.co/), [Google Image advanced search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/29508?hl=en), etc. Each site has clear attribution requirements: generally, this means that you need to cite the author/artist and link back to the original work in your course. 
* **Open Educational Resources:** A number of platforms and individuals license their materials for free reuse, which often means that you choose between linking out to the original source and re-publishing their content directly on your site. We’ve [outlined many platforms](https://p2pu.github.io/notes-on-edtech/) that utilize Creative Commons \(or equivalent\) licenses; be sure to familiarize yourself with the [various types](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) of CC licenses before republishing anything.

When in doubt, reach out! You might be surprised how responsive people are when you’re trying to share their work with new audiences.
