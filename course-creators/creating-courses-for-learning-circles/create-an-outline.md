# Create an Outline

Once you’ve established the goals for a course, outline 2–3 learning goals for each individual meeting and begin arranging course materials into the learning circle framework. When scoping out the learning materials, keep in mind the 6-8 week length of learning circle: we tend to think about the learning content as being more than a workshop, but less than a semester’s worth of work.

### Course intro

Your course should have a landing page, which outlines basic expectations for the course. In addition to the title, here are a few things you could include:

* Who you are and why you created the course
* Major learning objectives for the course
* Expected pacing for working through the material
* Any needed prerequisites or expectations for participants
* Supplemental resources to help a facilitator prepare
