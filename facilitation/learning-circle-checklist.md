# Learning circle checklist

Here you will find a checklist that outlines the steps needed to get your learning circle running. You can compress or expand this timeline to suit your needs. However, if you don’t already have a dedicated group of learners, we recommend spending four weeks promoting your learning circle once you’ve finalized the date, time, course, and location.

## Before You Begin

* Discuss plans with the MCL Learning Circle Team\(?\) or Steph Miller, including
  * Intended audience and their potential learning objectives
  * [Library priorities](https://multcolib.org/about/priorities) and goals being supported
  * Course choice, number of sessions and length of each session
  * Dates & Times
  * Staff and/or volunteers involved, including who is Facilitator and Tech Moderator
  * Ensure Facilitator has been invited to MCL’s P2PU Team account
  * Ensure manager approval for time and involvement before moving forward

## 4 weeks prior

* Publish course online through MCL’s P2PU website & MCL’s Events page
  * Create Zoom meeting using [MCLTech account](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HikcHogfC5AadGGunMGbGGAoQz6IpmdBvIvnLnLfCAU/edit#heading=h.k37jvlm3c546)
    * Enter Topic = name of learning circle and staff involved
    * Enter When, Duration \(of each session\) and use Recurring meeting, when possible
      * Note: If the circle sessions don’t fit the pattern offered by Zoom, select the number of recurrences and you will be able to adjust these on the next page
    * Click Save
    * Click Show all occurrences to ensure all of the dates and times are correct or if they need to be edited
    * Add to your MCL Google Calendar
    * Copy the Invite Link for use with the P2PU portal  
  * Create P2PU Course through [MCL’s P2PU portal](https://www.p2pu.org/multcolib/) - login and select Start a learning circle from the menu. Note: Your work will not be saved until Step 5 is completed. More information 
* Step 1: Select a course
  * If the course is already in the P2PU database, search for it and click Use This Course - if it’s not already in the P2PU database, click Add a Course in the right-hand panel

3. Click Close signup - we will reopen when ready to promote

* Create the Event Planner listing - send Steph Miller P2PU course link and original image link to create an event on the library’s website - this information and the Event Planner event link will also be used on MCL’s social media platforms and in MCL’s newsletters. Steph will share the Event Planner event link back for review and for using with additional promotion.
* Reopen learning circle in P2PU site to promote  
* Promote program
  * Create a flyer for community partners and library locations - use an [MCL flyer template](https://commons.multcolib.org/marketing-online-engagement/flyers-templates-and-resources#Event%20flyer%20templates) or create your own, including details noted in the MCL flyer templates

  * Explore the online course and create a simple outline or detailed guide for your course
    * One may already exist and has been posted on the [P2PU Community Forum](https://community.p2pu.org/) that can be customized
    * MCL also has a [event outline for virtual events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AaEyNbGdzeYEtHeADdVSJabIYzdENLhKmwIiTmx6_BE/edit#heading=h.4y8aw9w971cc) that includes helpful general tips and information for running virtual events

## 2 weeks prior

* Manage your learning circle
* The P2PU website does not have a way to cap registrations, so you will want to keep an eye on registrations - an ideal number of participants is 5-12, but there will be folks who sign up who won’t be able to attend, so you’ll want to allow a higher number of sign ups.
* You can close registrations from the Dashboard - here’s how:
  1. Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
  2. Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
  3. Click Close signup
* Practice with Zoom and decide on details
  * Schedule a Zoom practice session with your learning circle team to cover who is doing what, how information will be presented and to get comfortable with the Zoom controls
  * You may want to meet with your learning circle team between each session to reflect on the previous meeting and to adjust for the next meeting

## Before each learning circle meeting

* Communication with learners
  * The P2PU portal will automatically send the following emails to learners
    * Confirmation of registration
    * A reminder email 2 days before each meeting that allows the learner to RSVP and resends the circle Zoom link
  * Facilitator might need to send additional communication to learners - here’s how:

1. Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
2. Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
3. Scroll down to the Messages section and either
   * click Edit to the right of the message you would like to update the automatic message that will be sent by the site 
   * click New Message to send a new note to all learners

## After each learning  circle meeting

* Capture feedback and communication with learners
  * Facilitators should complete this process after each meeting - this process will include communicating to learners about the meeting, sharing insights with the P2PU community and capturing stats
    * Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
    * Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
    * To the right of each meeting, click Capture feedback - you will be asked to enter the following:
      * For learners: Write a brief summary of this week's learning circle - You may want to include your impressions of how it went, plus/delta feedback, and anything the group agreed on having completed before the next meeting. This will be automatically sent to learners two days before next week's meeting.
      * For the rest of us \(P2PU community\): Anything you want to share? - What went well this week? What surprised you? Any funny stories? We'll pull what you write here into our community newsletters and updates.
      * How many people attended? These stats will be captured for MCL’s event stats
      * Rating how the week's class went

## Final learning circle meeting

* Surveys 
  * The P2PU portal will send emails to both the learners and facilitators before the final meetings, asking them to complete a survey about their experience
    * Ask learners to complete this survey during the final meeting during plus/delta
    * Facilitators should complete their survey immediately after the final session
    * The survey results \(called Insight Report\) will be shared with learners, facilitators and team organizers 2 days after the last meeting
