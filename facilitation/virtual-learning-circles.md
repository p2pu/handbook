# Virtual Learning Circles

Learning circles were designed to held in person in accessible public spaces to foster strong community connections and support those with limited digital access at home. 

This page is an adaptation of the [Virtual Learning Circles Facilitator Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#), a document created in April 2020 to support those exploring accessible adult education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Set Your Intent

No matter where they're meeting, learning circles are rooted in P2PU’s [three core values](https://www.p2pu.org/en/about): community, peer learning, and equity. As you're planning online programs, it’s useful to keep these values in mind and refer back to them when you hit a roadblock.

Learning circles work best when learners can identify what motivates their participation, and the same is true for the facilitator. The questions we’ve been asking new facilitators for five years are still relevant for virtual programs:

* What are you personally hoping to achieve by facilitating a learning circle? 
* What need are you trying to address in your community?
* Who do you expect to reach?
* How will you know if your experiment was a success?

## Accessible Learning Materials

Learning circle participants come together around a common interest, supported by freely accessible learning materials. As the facilitator, it is your job to identify these materials before the learning circle begins. Most facilitators use free online courses as their subject material because they are widely accessible, developed by subject matter experts, and often designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study.

When public access to library equipment, internet connection, and in-person support are a limited or unavailable option, it's important to keep in mind the types of access barriers your learners may have. As you’re assessing courses, here are some extra considerations for choosing the right material:

* **Support for low bandwidth:** If your learners don’t have reliable internet connections at home, courses with fewer videos and interactive elements might be more accessible. 
* **Mobile-friendly:** Many learners may not have a computer but can still participate via a smartphone or tablet. Fortunately, some course providers \(including edX, FutureLearn, Coursera, and Udacity\) offer mobile apps.
* **Digital literacy:** Will learners need guidance or tech support to navigate a course website on their own? 
* **Tool Requirements:** Consider the things your learners will need to complete a learning circle. Are there tools or materials they need to anticipate having access to?
* **Workload:** It’s likely that the online course you choose was developed prior to the pandemic. Be prepared to only use a fraction of the online course and set achievable goals as everyone is learning in a much more demanding and complex environment.
