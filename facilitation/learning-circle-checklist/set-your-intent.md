# Set Your Intent

**Set Your Intent**

Learning circles work best when learners can identify what motivates their participation, and the same is true for the facilitator. The questions we’ve been asking new facilitators for five years are still relevant for virtual programs:

* What are you personally hoping to achieve by facilitating a learning circle?
* What need are you trying to address in your community?
* Who do you expect to reach?
* How will you know if your experiment was a success?
* \[note -- distinguishing between a facilitator wanting to find people to learn with versus running a program to meet a community need\]

**Check in with your people**

Once you’ve established your personal goals for a learning circle, you’ll want to start sharing your ideas and gathering buy-in from people who will help you along the way. This may include reaching out to people who you think might want to participate, organizations that might help you promote your learning circle, or a group that you are part of that can give you feedback on your idea. You are also, of course, welcome to reach out to P2PU at any time if you want our input! 

### **Check in with the wider community**

If you want to solicit feedback from a wider audience, such as your library’s mailing list, you may need to come up with a more scalable solution than soliciting 1-1 feedback. Our favorite strategy for doing this is called the [Q Method](https://community.p2pu.org/t/q-method-for-documenting-community-interests/2699), a dot-based voting methodology that we’ve used for years to solicit interest for potential learning circle topics. To try this online, you can use a standard survey tool \(such as [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), or [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)\), where responses are aggregated and shared with you privately, or a collaborative polling tool \(such as [Tricider](https://www.tricider.com/), [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/), or [AnswerGarden](https://answergarden.ch/)\), where responses are shared publicly.

⭐ If you are looking to ask multiple questions and/or be able to connect responses to individual respondents, then you are best off using a standard survey tool. We use Google Forms frequently at P2PU, and we’ve made a  [Q Method survey template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5TByw6oXOFz3EluzEiZ_aA6BdWKQg0oBGSjWPW1XgkSMVbA/viewform?usp=sf_link)  that you can riff off of for your own uses.  
****

⭐ If you’re only interested in asking a single question \(e.g. what topics are you interested in learning?\) and you want respondents to be able to see what other people have suggested, then you should use a collaborative polling tool. Tricider works well if you want people to share more complex thoughts and upvote/respond to one another, and AnswerGarden works well if you want to gather short responses that become visualized as a wordcloud.

## Gathering input from your community

Before you start running learning circles, you may want to run a small outreach project in your community to both get the word out and better understand the needs of potential learning circle participants. Below, we outline a few ways that the P2PU community has developed or used to integrate community opinions into learning circle program planning!

#### The Q method <a id="the-q-method"></a>

The Q Method is a participatory public bulletin used to solicit feedback about course topics that people are interested in. It’s named after our friend Qumisha \(a.k.a. Q\) from Detroit Public Library, who came up with the idea as a way to promote learning circles at her library branch.

![The Q method in action](https://community.p2pu.org/uploads/default/original/1X/833de6b1554b25041b78c207017c36fdbf316714.jpg)

As you can see in the example above, the most popular course with 20 votes was Marketing in a Digital World. There was a tie for second place – Introduction to Public Speaking and Social Entrepreneurship 101 both received 16 votes. Based on the results, the Q offered both the marketing and public speaking courses as learning circles.

What’s great about the Q Method is that it both invites community contribution for deciding topics, and serves to promote the program. This concept has been re-used by learning circle facilitators around the world, and can also have applications for other community feedback issues, such as strategic planning, programming decision-making, and understanding community satisfaction and engagement. Our our community forum, you can [download a template](https://community.p2pu.org/t/q-method-for-documenting-community-interests/2699/2) to create your own Q method and see how others have implemented it around the world.

#### Focus groups <a id="focus-groups"></a>

If you want more feedback on program design, you may wish to bring a small group of people together and ask them questions about what they are looking for in learning circles. This is a great way to not only generate data and insight, but also to get to know people and build relationships. In Kenya, libraries run focus groups as part of their learning circle training; we’ve adapted their focus group questions for you [on the forum](https://community.p2pu.org/t/library-patron-focus-group/3129).

#### Community partnerships <a id="community-partnerships"></a>

Watch this video clip of Athanasia Fitos, a librarian from Miami, discussing the role of community partnerships in building a successful learning circle community. As you watch, think about \(or discuss\) your responses to these questions:

* How do you currently understand and document the needs, interests, and experiences of the various communities you serve?
* Which communities does your organization not serve who you might want to reach?
* What audiences or communities do you aim to serve through learning circles, and what might benefit or interest them most?
