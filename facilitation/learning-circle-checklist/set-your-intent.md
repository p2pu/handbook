# Set Your Intent

Learning circles work best when learners can identify what motivates their participation, and the same is true for the facilitator. As you begin thinking about the learning circles you want to run, here are some questions you can ask to set your intent:

* What are you personally hoping to achieve by facilitating a learning circle?
* What need are you trying to address in your community?
* Who do you expect to reach?
* How will you know if your experiment was a success?

Once you’ve established your personal goals for a learning circle, you’ll want to start sharing your ideas and gathering buy-in from people who will help you along the way. This may include reaching out to people who you think might want to participate, organizations that might help you promote your learning circle, or a group that you are part of that can give you feedback on your idea. You are also, of course, welcome to reach out to P2PU at any time if you want our input! 

## **Identifying Community Interests**

If your goal is to run programs that support the needs of your local community, you may want to gather insights and interests from prospective learners. By working with partner organizations and networks, building strong relationships between you and people around you, and outreaching to specific audiences, you’ll be much better suited to know what people in your local area want to learn and how to reach them.

Community outreach can be done successfully in a variety of ways, in-person and online, and will often depend on your unique resources and circumstances. Here are some popular tools and strategies:

* **Promotion:** Use organizational or local mailing lists, neighborhood apps \(like [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/)\), local social media groups, or other local outreach lists to reach a number of people in your community with questions or surveys. We use Google Forms frequently at P2PU and have a [topic survey template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5TByw6oXOFz3EluzEiZ_aA6BdWKQg0oBGSjWPW1XgkSMVbA/viewform?usp=sf_link)  that you can riff off of for your own uses. Collaborative polling tool like [Tricider](https://www.tricider.com/) are also great for starting conversations between respondents. 
* **Focus Groups:** In Kenya, libraries run [mini focus groups](https://community.p2pu.org/t/library-patron-focus-group/3129) as part of their learning circle training. They get a quick idea of what their local library patrons are interested in and their digital literacy skills which they can use for discussion as they continue their training workshop. Some libraries have offered a learning circle teaser or public orientation where they introduce the concept of learning circles through an informal meeting or large presentation and, through these meetings, they also receive feedback about what people are interested in learning
* **Assess interests of and gather data from current students or patrons:** Observation and insights gathered from each branch and location is key to understanding your unique community. If you're part of a library, you can use collections data or access stats from institutional memberships \(like Lynda.com\) to understand what your patrons are seeking out.
* **Ask local businesses:** Visiting a number of local businesses and simply asking what skills or community programs they feel are missing.

## The Q Method

The Q Method is a participatory public bulletin used to solicit feedback about course topics that people are interested in. It’s named after our friend Qumisha \(a.k.a. Q\) from Detroit Public Library, who came up with the idea as a way to promote learning circles at her library branch.

The Q Method, a dot-based voting methodology that we’ve used for years to solicit interest for potential learning circle topics. To try this online, you can use a standard survey tool \(such as [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), or [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)\), where responses are aggregated and shared with you privately, or a collaborative polling tool \(such as [Tricider](https://www.tricider.com/), [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/), or [AnswerGarden](https://answergarden.ch/)\), where responses are shared publicly.

![The Q method in action](https://community.p2pu.org/uploads/default/original/1X/833de6b1554b25041b78c207017c36fdbf316714.jpg)

As you can see in the example above, the most popular course with 20 votes was Marketing in a Digital World. There was a tie for second place – Introduction to Public Speaking and Social Entrepreneurship 101 both received 16 votes. Based on the results, the Q offered both the marketing and public speaking courses as learning circles.

What’s great about the Q Method is that it both invites community contribution for deciding topics, and serves to promote the program. This concept has been re-used by learning circle facilitators around the world, and can also have applications for other community feedback issues, such as strategic planning, programming decision-making, and understanding community satisfaction and engagement. Our our community forum, you can [download a template](https://community.p2pu.org/t/q-method-for-documenting-community-interests/2699/2) to create your own Q method and see how others have implemented it around the world.

#### Focus groups <a id="focus-groups"></a>

If you want more feedback on program design, you may wish to bring a small group of people together and ask them questions about what they are looking for in learning circles. This is a great way to not only generate data and insight, but also to get to know people and build relationships. In Kenya, libraries run focus groups as part of their learning circle training; we’ve adapted their focus group questions for you [on the forum](https://community.p2pu.org/t/library-patron-focus-group/3129).

#### Community partnerships <a id="community-partnerships"></a>

Watch this video clip of Athanasia Fitos, a librarian from Miami, discussing the role of community partnerships in building a successful learning circle community. As you watch, think about \(or discuss\) your responses to these questions:

* How do you currently understand and document the needs, interests, and experiences of the various communities you serve?
* Which communities does your organization not serve who you might want to reach?
* What audiences or communities do you aim to serve through learning circles, and what might benefit or interest them most?
