# Set Up Your Space

A consistent meeting space can go a long way towards learning circle feel like a comfortable learning environment. Whenever possible, regardless of meeting online or in person, look for a meeting space that you can use reliably for the duration of your learning circle. 

## Meeting In Person

When meeting in person it is important that you reserve a meeting space for your learning circle, and consider if your space has the necessary equipment for your learning circle subject. The minimum amount of equipment needed is enough chairs and space for everyone to sit in a circle. However you may find it helpful or necessary to have additional equipment such as a projector to share video content with the group, or if the class is more technical you may need space for each person to have access to a computer.

Chances are that you can’t make major changes to the space that you are meeting in for your learning circle. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make a few small changes that will improve the experience for yourself and your peers.

**ESSENTIALS**

* Easily accessible space
* Consistent access to power and free internet
* Accommodation for any physical and/or learning disabilities in the group
* Restroom availability

**DESIRABLE**

* A large wall that you can project onto
* Natural light \(studies show that people learn better with it\)
* Modular seating arrangements
* Near public transport / free parking

**MAKE SURE**

* Have the times been reserved for each weeks?
* Do you have access to any keys that you need?
* Do you know the wifi network name and password?
* Do you know where chairs, tables, and additional supplies are stored?
* Are you aware of any rules determining what time you must finish by each week?

### Accessibility Considerations

## Meeting Online

There are dozens of free tools that allow people to work together in virtual spaces: video conferences, group phone calls, collaborative writing platforms. You shouldn’t need to spend any money to run or host an effective online learning circle.

Things to consider when choosing your online setup:

* Are there specific supplies or technical requirements \(software, equipment, etc.\) needed to complete your learning circle topic? 
* What resources \(computer, smartphone, tablet, internet access\) do your learners have access to? 
* What tools do your learners already know how to use?
* Are your learners comfortable appearing in video or phone calls?
* Do you have colleagues who can provide insight, experience, or ideas about the right tools for your community?

Experienced facilitators recommended polling participants before or after sign-up to understand which resources they have access to and are comfortable using. You may discover that your community has limited access to the tools you planned to use.

### **Our Recommendation: Jitsi + Etherpad**

Because many facilitators are locked into institutional requirements and it’d be impossible to address every learning circle’s unique tech needs, this is not a hefty tool comparison. \(Looking for a comprehensive guide? We recommend [Mozilla’s Video Call Apps list](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/video-call-apps/)!\) Instead, we’re getting right to our recommended setup: Jitsi video calls + Etherpad collaborative text documents.

#### **⭐** [**Jitsi**](https://meet.jit.si/) **\(Video Conferencing w/ Screenshare, Dial-In, Text\)**

![Preview of a group Jitsi call during an individual reading activity: most participants have video turned off and one participant is screen-sharing a countdown timer](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CP8yTAy6Q4e-j3eJdL_XXYQvCCRie2iQ9EwMiS64j898aBL7mi8Y9W7iadTCrLoBqtLn9Az__j5Jy8YeophAhERa-nM1U2RAOPdD870vcSmTnzcJ335-mCgz1ggoExAEsr3Fki_E)

Jitsi is a free, open-source video tool that takes safety seriously and doesn’t require an account registration or software download on computers. No frills or friction: participants can click a link and immediately join. It works in most web browsers and on iOS/Android smartphones with a free app. 

#### Get started: [meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si/)

Max Participants: Jitsi recommends no more than 35 people on video at one time. In our tests, quality starts to go down with more than 12–15 users. 

Dial-In: Jitsi generates dial-in numbers so learners without a webcam, computer, or smartphone can join the room via phone.

Privacy/Encryption: Jitsi is privacy-oriented and keeps participants’ data \(location, identity\) safe and encrypted. More about that at [Jitsi Meet Security & Privacy](https://jitsi.org/security/).

URLs and Passwords: Jitsi lets you set custom URLs and passwords for a meeting room to make sure the right people find it and the wrong people don’t. \(Note: Password settings reset every time the room is empty, so you must be the first one to join the room to set the password.\)

Participant Responsibility: Jitsi is minimally hierarchical—anyone can mute or kick anyone—which allows learners to take on co-facilitation roles in the group.

Etherpad is a highly customizable open source text editor that allows for collaborative writing in real-time. Each editor sets their own color so you can follow individual contributions. \(This can also be turned off.\) We’ve had success using this for sharing meeting agendas, collaborative writing exercises, and silent reflections \(like check-in questions or [plus/deltas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.ikjjxp4uht5f) at the end of a meeting\).

#### Get started: [etherpad.p2pu.org](https://etherpad.p2pu.org/)

We’ve hosted an instance of Etherpad on our website \(linked above\) so you can just pick a URL and go. If you or a colleague are familiar with Git, you can also [install Etherpad](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite#installation) yourself and customize it to your needs with [community-created plugins](https://static.etherpad.org/index.html). \(Have a plugin request for the P2PU Etherpad?

### Considering Privacy and Safety

There are a few different steps that you can take to ensure that your group remains free of people who show up with ulterior motives. 

* Create very unique URLs for your meeting room and don’t post the link publicly on the web \(like on your sign-up page\). This will minimize random visitors or ne'er-do-wells. You can share meeting links privately with participants via email once they’ve registered. 
* Add a password. If you have any concerns, add a password to your room. You can always change this if needed. 
* Keep an eye on who signs up. Your P2PU facilitator dashboard lets you see who is signing up—if a participant has written anything that raises a red flag for you, you can either send them a message directly or simply remove them from the learning circle. 

Learn how to kick users. Most video chat tools have a feature to remove participants from a meeting. However, it may not prevent them from rejoining. Make sure to add or change the room password before kicking a user to prevent them from getting back in.

### Online Accessibility Considerations

The tools you choose to use in your learning circle can go a long way towards creating an environment that benefits all participants. 

* **Research the accessibility of your meeting tool.** Can it be used with assistive technologies like screen readers? Or just a keyboard, for participants who cannot use a mouse?
* **Check for closed caption support** in your course materials and meeting platform. If your meeting platform doesn’t automatically support them, consider asking a colleague or fellow learner to write captions or notes to help all participants follow along.
* **Increase your cursor size and narrate actions and visuals** if you plan to do any demonstrations with screen sharing. 
* **Test your audio setup with others and practice speaking** to make sure your words are understandable and your environment is free of distracting sounds. Consider investing in a microphone or headset if you plan to facilitate lots of meetings.
