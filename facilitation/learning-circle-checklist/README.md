# Learning Circle Checklist

Facilitating a learning circle requires about 3 hours per week on the part of the facilitator, most of which is spent in the actual learning circle. In addition to that, some time is often needed for set up, clean-up \(if meeting in person\), communicating with learners between each meeting, and familiarizing with the upcoming week of course materials.

Below is a recommended checklist that outlines the steps needed to get your learning circle running. We recommend that you schedule your first learning circle at least four weeks in the future, but you can compress or expand this timeline to suit your needs. If you don’t already have a dedicated group of learners, we recommend spending four weeks promoting your learning circle once you’ve finalized the date, time, course, and location.

## Before You Begin

* Connect with your community, colleagues, or personal goals to identify:
  * Intended learner audience and their potential learning objectives
  * Your organization's priorities and/or goals being supported
* Decide your learning circle details:
  * Choice of course/learning materials
  * Number of meetings and length of each session
  * Meeting Dates & Times
  * Where you'll meet
* Confirm supplies will be available \(laptops, headphones, pens, nametags, snacks, etc.\)
* Reach out to affiliated or relevant local organizations to share your plans and look for advertising opportunities

## 4 weeks prior

* Create your learning circle using P2PU's free tools \(see [Creating learning circles](../../tools-and-resources/tools-for-learning-circles/creating-learning-circles.md)\)
* Begin promoting online and offline \(see [Promote your learning circle](promotion-and-outreach.md)\)
* Connect with local communities to find prospective participants

## 2 weeks prior

* Develop a facilitator's guide for yourself by exploring the learning materials and creating an outline for how you want to proceed through the materials 
* * Manage your learning circle
* The P2PU website does not have a way to cap registrations, so you will want to keep an eye on registrations - an ideal number of participants is 5-12, but there will be folks who sign up who won’t be able to attend, so you’ll want to allow a higher number of sign ups.
* You can close registrations from the Dashboard - here’s how:
  1. Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
  2. Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
  3. Click Close signup
* Practice with Zoom and decide on details
  * Schedule a Zoom practice session with your learning circle team to cover who is doing what, how information will be presented and to get comfortable with the Zoom controls
  * You may want to meet with your learning circle team between each session to reflect on the previous meeting and to adjust for the next meeting



* Confirm with all registered learners
* Confirm with venue
* Gather supplies

## Before each learning circle meeting

* Communication with learners
  * The P2PU portal will automatically send the following emails to learners
    * Confirmation of registration
    * A reminder email 2 days before each meeting that allows the learner to RSVP and resends the circle Zoom link
  * Facilitator might need to send additional communication to learners - here’s how:

1. Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
2. Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
3. Scroll down to the Messages section and either
   * click Edit to the right of the message you would like to update the automatic message that will be sent by the site 
   * click New Message to send a new note to all learners

## After each learning  circle meeting

* Capture feedback and communication with learners
  * Facilitators should complete this process after each meeting - this process will include communicating to learners about the meeting, sharing insights with the P2PU community and capturing stats
    * Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
    * Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
    * To the right of each meeting, click Capture feedback - you will be asked to enter the following:
      * For learners: Write a brief summary of this week's learning circle - You may want to include your impressions of how it went, plus/delta feedback, and anything the group agreed on having completed before the next meeting. This will be automatically sent to learners two days before next week's meeting.
      * For the rest of us \(P2PU community\): Anything you want to share? - What went well this week? What surprised you? Any funny stories? We'll pull what you write here into our community newsletters and updates.
      * How many people attended? These stats will be captured for MCL’s event stats
      * Rating how the week's class went

## Final learning circle meeting

* Surveys 
  * The P2PU portal will send emails to both the learners and facilitators before the final meetings, asking them to complete a survey about their experience
    * Ask learners to complete this survey during the final meeting during plus/delta
    * Facilitators should complete their survey immediately after the final session
    * The survey results \(called Insight Report\) will be shared with learners, facilitators and team organizers 2 days after the last meeting
