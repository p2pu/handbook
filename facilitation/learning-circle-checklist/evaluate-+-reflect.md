# Evaluate + Reflect

Once your learning circle wraps up, what comes next? Here are some common paths forward:

* **Run another learning circle:** Every foray into facilitation informs the next. Consider running the learning circle again and experimenting with new techniques. Or try a new topic altogether!
* **Improve the course:** We automatically generate a forum thread for every course added to the P2PU library where facilitators can share their feedback and ideas. \([Example!](https://community.p2pu.org/t/3d-printing-spokane-county-library-district/4020)\) These discussions appear on the course pages and inform future facilitators on how to best bring that material to their community. 
* **Write about your experience:** Many people are forging their own paths through this unfamiliar territory, and a very common request is for more case studies and insights from experienced facilitators. Your stories are welcome and encouraged in our [community forum](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/testimony).
* **Join a community call or working group:** P2PU hosts monthly community calls and occasional working groups that bring facilitators together to discuss ideas and offer support. [**See a list of all upcoming events.**](https://community.p2pu.org/c/community-events/)\*\*\*\*

## Automatic Insight Surveys

At the end of every learning circle, learners and facilitators automatically receive an email with a survey asking them to reflect upon the goal they first set, feedback about the learning circle \(what worked well vs. what could be improved\), and what their next steps will be. The survey responses are used to generate a “learning circle insights” summary \([example](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/923/report/)\) that is shared with the facilitator, team organizers, and learners as well as on the public facilitator dashboard for others to learn from.

P2PU will only send out one email to participants about filling out the closing survey, and your learning circle's management page will show you who has and hasn't responded. Many facilitators like to send a small nudge to remind learners to give feedback:

> **Example email template:**
>
> Hi there,
>
> Can you take a few minutes to let me know how your learning circle went? Your feedback - the good and the bad - will improve the learning circle program for learners and facilitators around the world.
>
> Share your feedback here: &lt;survey link&gt;
>
> Thank you!

If you have other insights you’re after, consider distributing your own survey. Sébastien in Boston collected brief but informative responses via a simplified plus/delta survey \([see it here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZKeESfAyr2TNLzGm2S6SjyVqtEN_wyaRBWU1xZu5Mbw/edit)\) that he sent to his participants to get short, weekly feedback and also gather interest for new learning circles.

## Certificates & Accreditation

P2PU does not issue any kind of accreditation or formal education certificates. Some courses offer various types of endorsement though learners often have to pay the course provider for a copy.

A number of facilitators like to give certificates at the end of a learning circle to help connote a sense of achievement and stronger connection between the library/learning center and learner. If you want to recognize and celebrate learners’ achievements, you can use or customize our [certificate template](https://community.p2pu.org/t/certificate-template/2784).
