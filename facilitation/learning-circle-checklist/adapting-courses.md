# Adapt Your Course

Learning circle participants come together around a common interest, supported by freely accessible learning materials. As the facilitator, it is your job to identify these materials before the learning circle begins. Most facilitators use free online courses for subject material because they are widely accessible, developed by subject matter experts, and often designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study. 

You do not need to be an expert in the course material in order to facilitate a learning circle. However, whether you are looking on P2PU’s course database or elsewhere on the web, you’ll want to review the course before you create a learning circle.

So, what exactly, makes a course work well for learning circles?

Many facilitators find it helpful to adapt course materials into a weekly agenda to structure their learning circle. Some choose to use these just for personal reference while others share them with their learners so everyone can keep track of progress together. Here are some examples from our community:
