# Adapt the Course

As many online courses are designed for individual study, you'll sometimes find that the right learning material for your learning circle doesn't fit neatly into a learning circle structure. When that happens, you can either improvise with your learners during meetings or, using the learning circle [typical structure](https://app.gitbook.com/@peer-2-peer-university/s/p2pu-knowledge-base/~/drafts/-MYBqKw2d0_DgWHithpq/methodology/learning-circle-structure) as your guide, you can plan ahead how best to present the course material to your learning circle. 

Some adaptations that you may need or want to make:

* Adding [check-ins](https://handbook.p2pu.org/methodology/learning-circle-structure#check-in), icebreakers, and [reflections](https://handbook.p2pu.org/methodology/learning-circle-structure#check-in)
* Changing the length of time to cover a section or module of content
* Rearranging the order of content within a course
* [Adding or adapting activities](../../methodology/learning-circle-structure.md#learn-and-do)
* Supplementing the course content with additional materials \(see [Finding "the Answer"](../facilitation-basics.md#finding-the-answer)\) 

### Facilitator Guides & Agendas

Many facilitators find it helpful to develop a weekly agenda to help structure their course materials in the learning circle format. Some facilitators choose to use these just for personal reference while others share them with their learners so everyone can keep track of progress together, and take collective notes. You can draft the materials in whatever tool you’re comfortable with, including Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, or P2PU’s hosted version of[ Etherpad](https://etherpad.p2pu.org/).

Whenever possible, P2PU generalizes these agendas and shares them as Facilitator Guides. Facilitator guides are agendas for courses which highlight adaptations made to the original course materials and additional materials used.  These guides provide facilitators the benefit of seeing how another facilitator has previously adapted a course for learning circles.
