# Adapt Your Course

Learning circle participants come together around a common interest, supported by freely accessible learning materials. As the facilitator, it is your job to identify these materials before the learning circle begins. Most facilitators use free online courses for subject material because they are widely accessible, developed by subject matter experts, and often designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study. 

P2PU maintains a library of courses that have been successfully run as learning circles on our website.

Once you’ve searched for courses and evaluated them, the final step is to adapt them for learning circles. As we mentioned in the first module, not all online courses are as learning circle friendly as this one is, so as a facilitator, you’ll need to take steps to adapt the course to the learning circle format. So, what exactly, makes a course work well for learning circles?

**Many facilitators find it helpful to adapt course materials into a weekly agenda to structure their learning circle. Some choose to use these just for personal reference while others share them with their learners so everyone can keep track of progress together. Here are some examples from our community:**
