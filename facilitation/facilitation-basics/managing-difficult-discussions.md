# Managing discussions

**What if there are conflicts between participants that I will have to mediate?**

Depending on the topic and how passionate your participants are about the subject materials conflicts can arise.   

It’s not possible to know what kind of conflicts will arise but you can handle those by establishing group norms with your learning circle participants on the first day.

see.Group Norms- are these somewhere else?

 Group norms are not just for the first day you can revisit them at the end or beginning of subsequent meetings to make sure that your group norms still fit your group’s needs. Its okay for the group to change them as necessary.  


We also like these tactical tips from [this article and TED Talk by Adar Cohen  
](https://ideas.ted.com/3-steps-to-having-difficult-but-necessary-conversations/)1. Move toward not away from conflict.  

Conflict can be an opportunity to explore a problem or concern more deeply.  Engage participants with questions that allow them to explain their opinions or comments

2. Act as if you don’t know anything about the situation even if you do.

Acting as if you don’t know anything gives you the space to learn and hear information that you may not have, if you immediately jumped in with your personal assumptions.

3. Keep quiet, especially at the beginning.

**What if none of the participants talk and there is lots of silence**

Don't be afraid of silence. Silence is an opportunity for someone new to speak up and for the group to gather their thoughts. If you feel awkward in silence, someone else probably does too. You can try counting to 10 if you need some help leaning into silence.

**What if I fail at providing what a learning circle is supposed to accomplish.**

Learning Circles are flexible, set your goal as a facilitator, encourage participants to set their own goals and be clear about what the course content covers.

**What if I and or participants have technical difficulties.**

Technical difficulties happen and can vary widely.  Whether you are leading a virtual or in person learning circle.  Take a deep breath and be patient with yourself and others. 

If you have participants who drop out of a virtual meeting you can reach out to them after the meeting with meeting wrap up  notes, and any comments or directions they might have missed.

If you have participants with chronic technical difficulties i.e. no microphone or no video.  You may want to reach out to those participants to make sure that they feel comfortable giving input other ways ie chat or using raise hand or reaction features.

If you as a facilitator are having technical difficulties, try this process. 1. Can I work around this? By making moderate changes  2. Is this causing the group to miss out on information they need and if so can I send it after the meeting.  3.  Is this problem such that this meeting needs to be canceled or rescheduled until I can find a solution.

**What if the group has questions that I can’t answer on the spot.**

As a facilitator you are not a teacher, or a subject matter expert, and it is not the facilitator’s role to solve all of the group's problems or have on demand answers.

You can support your learning circle by encouraging participants to look up answers outside of the learning circle, and share information and resources that they find back with the group. Remember you are a participant too and you can also look up additional resources to present to the group, but that is not the sole responsibility of the facilitator**.**
