# Facilitation Basics

Every learning circle has a facilitator. The facilitator does not have to be an expert in the subject, so with a little practice and training, anybody can facilitate. **Facilitated, not taught:** Gently guided but not taught—with a little practice and training, anyone should be able to facilitate! You're the host, everything set up, and encourager of peer learning. While you're responsibility for the fidelity of the model, you're not responsible for everything that happens with in it.

For many people, moving learning circles to a virtual environment adds a new set of responsibilities which can feel like a lot to manage. We isolate them in part to help you prepare, and also to identify roles and responsibilities that you may want to delegate to a co-facilitator or a willing participant.

## Who is a facilitator?

You!!

## Gathering the Group 

Since you can’t meet in person, you’ll need to do a little extra work to decide where and how to meet virtually. This includes deciding on a form of synchronous communication \(e.g. video chat, conference call, shared notes\) and deciding whether you want to implement any asynchronous communication \(e.g. Whatsapp group, email thread, Slack channel\). Review the [Pick Your Tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.2jjrsjmq2kky) section, and remember you’re free to change which tool you’re using if it makes it easier for all learners to participate. A few notes to highlight:

In online meetings, the embedded chat channel can serve as a nice space for backchannel conversation and an essential place for link sharing. It may also be the case that some participants do not have access to a working microphone and are therefore only able to communicate via the chat. Delegating chat management to somebody else can be a great way to involve others in the leadership of the learning circle while not overwhelming you as a facilitator.

* With virtual learning circles, it’s particularly important to reach out to everybody before the first meeting and outline what tools you’ll be using, how they should connect, and where they should go if they have any questions. Take a look at these [learning circle message examples](https://community.p2pu.org/t/promotional-email-messaging-examples/4503) for inspiration.
* A number of virtual learning circles have utilized [breakout rooms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.zfy3senzr3r). We recommend setting these up in advance so that you have less to manage during the learning circle itself.
* You may also want to send a recap to participants after each meeting. Once you [create a learning circle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5Y96YTPbXay1iDgKiFoD-uA2AixvJNt3a380L0yOWc/edit#heading=h.1n4i85girde2) on the P2PU platform, you will be able to send messages to all learning circle participants by email and SMS.

## Facilitating Discussion 

Typically, each learning circle meeting consists of four components: a check-in, time spent working through an online course, a group activity, and a reflection exercise. We find that the overarching format -- a mix of self-paced reading and group activities, sandwiched between a check-in and reflection activity -- still works well in a virtual space. P2PU has a wealth of knowledge and interest in advancing the facilitation of group discussions. We recommend reviewing our [facilitation responsibilities](https://p2pu.github.io/learning-about-learning-circles/modules/facilitation/read-&-watch/) and [facilitation section](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/facilitation) in the P2PU forum which includes videos and additional resources.

## Providing Technical Support

Online learning circles tend to use three browser tabs at any given time - one for the online course, one for the video chat, and one for a shared notes document. In addition to bandwidth limitations, this workflow can be extremely daunting for individuals who aren’t used to working and collaborating online. There are a number of ways that you can help mitigate these issues.

* Invite participants to show up in the online meeting space 15-20 minutes early to troubleshoot any tech issues that they may be having.
* Ask a colleague to join you for the first thirty minutes to help troubleshoot with individuals. Creating a separate video chat dedicated to tech support can be a great way to offer 1-1 help to somebody who is struggling while allowing the rest of the group to proceed with the learning materials.
* Start the learning circle with an orientation session; make it clear that it’s optional but is a good way for folks to learn more about the tools that will be used and the learning circle model before the group digs into the course content the following week.
* Share your screen. Demonstrating what you want participants to do can be a lot easier than trying to explain it. Make sure you are comfortable sharing your screen before the learning circle, and practice sharing your entire screen versus a dedicated window.
