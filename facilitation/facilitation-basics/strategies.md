# Strategies

**Model Peer Learning**

As discussed in the first module, some people will inevitably show up to a learning circle expecting a passive experience where you transmit information to them. From the beginning, you should avoid positioning yourself as the only person in the room with an answer, and encourage learners to help one another out along the way. All this being said, when we say that everybody has something to teach and learn, we mean you too! So don’t be afraid to lend a hand and offer assistance to learners along the way.

#### Listen to Learners <a id="listen-to-learners"></a>

Be observant, and learn to read the energy of the room. Who seems really motivated today? Who is particularly quiet? Once you have an understanding of each learner’s goals, you’ll be able to respond to this energy productively. Is one learner quiet because they are struggling with a basic concept? Ask somebody who is a few steps ahead if they don’t mind helping out.

#### Encourage Social Cohesion <a id="encourage-social-cohesion"></a>

Social cohesion begins to develop within the first hour that a new group spends time together, and as the facilitator you can do a lot to help people to self-identify as a member of the group. Some ideas on achieving this include:

* Agreeing on a group name
* Using non-verbal symbols \(mascot, logo, colors\)
* Establishing rituals \(traditions, habits, weekly activities\)
* Using plural pronouns \(“we” instead of “I”\)
* Invoking group metaphors \(referring to the group as a team\)
* Making verbal pledges \(commitments to future action\)
* Establishing group narrative \(saying things like “Remember when we…”\)
* Developing groupspeak \(inside jokes, jargon\)

#### Probe Assumptions and Clarify Statements <a id="probe-assumptions-and-clarify-statements"></a>

Learners will ask you many content related questions, since you are the closest thing to the traditional teacher in the room. When this happens, your response should demonstrate that their peers are a valuable resource, and that most questions are answerable by the group. Examples of responses you might give are: I’m not sure, did you ask anyone else if they ran up against the same problem? Hmmm, where would you start looking to figure that out? In general, think about giving suggestions rather than directions.

#### Encourage Meaningful, Frequent Interactions Between Learners <a id="encourage-meaningful-frequent-interactions-between-learners"></a>

Shared emotional connections serve the dual purpose of helping individuals learn and reinforcing community. You should look out for opportunities to summarize what you’ve heard and elicit new perspectives and viewpoints. If you find that questions or conversations are taking the group off track, you should feel comfortable intervening to get things back on track. Other learners will greatly appreciate this.

#### Manage Expectations <a id="manage-expectations"></a>

When learning something new, optimism can quickly turn into discouragement. To navigate this, express confidence that learners can achieve their goals, while also being realistic and aware of what is possible in six weeks. For instance, it’s unlikely that somebody with no programming background will get a fancy tech job after one HTML/CSS Learning Circle. However, they will gain a better understanding of how to build a website, get a sense as to whether this is a subject they’d like to continue in, and have a peer group of like-minded individuals they’ve gotten to know.

#### Encourage Growth Mindsets <a id="encourage-growth-mindsets"></a>

A growth mindset is the belief that one’s skills and abilities can be continually developed through hard work, rather than stay fixed at a certain level. As a facilitator, try praising a learner’s processes \(effort, strategies, choices\) rather than their innate intelligence \(e.g. saying “you’re so smart!”\).

#### Turn Frustrations Around <a id="turn-frustrations-around"></a>

Try to flip frustrations into positive statements and involve the group. For example, if learners in a job skills learning circle aren’t happy with the interview tips in the online course, ask the group if they can come up with better questions. You’ll find that often, the online course is merely a starting point for learners to bring their personal experiences into the learning circle.

#### Delegate Responsibilities <a id="delegate-responsibilities"></a>

A good facilitator empowers learners to take charge of their own learning, making the role of the facilitator smaller and smaller over time. As the learning circle progresses, you can start asking learners to take on some extra responsibility, such as:

* Helping other learners who are having technical issues
* Sending a wrap-up email afterwards reflecting on the meeting
* Summarizing the week’s material at the beginning of each meeting
* Setting up beforehand and cleaning up afterwards
* Sharing a resource or article that relates to the course content
* Helping a learner who is struggling
* Bringing snacks

#### Celebrate the process, not just the finished product <a id="celebrate-the-process-not-just-the-finished-product"></a>

Don’t forget to celebrate the journey along the way with learning circle participants. The check-in and reflection exercises are designed to help you all call out the journey.

#### Remember that facilitation is a practice <a id="remember-that-facilitation-is-a-practice"></a>

Don’t stress about being “good at it” right away. Becoming a learning circle facilitator will be a continuous process of trying, reflecting, and iterating. A few reflection questions to keep in mind as you begin:

* How might my cultural assumptions influence my interactions with learners?
* How might the backgrounds and experiences of learners influence their motivation, engagement, and learning?
* How can I modify course materials, activities, facilitation techniques, and expectations to be more accessible to all the learners in my learning circle?
