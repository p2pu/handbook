## Template messages to promote learning circles

In addition to [**flyers**](https://community.p2pu.org/t/learning-circle-flyer-template/2744/1) and online promotion, you may want to reach out directly to your partners, neighbors, and constituents through email or social media. Below are some template messages you can use to advertise your learning circle:

### **Internal email template**

Got a mailing list for your organization? Here's a starting template for finding potential learners:

> Are you interested in learning about **\[learn\]** but don’t want to study alone? Why not join our learning circle and study face-to-face with your peers?
>
> From **\[date\]** to **\[date\]** we’ll be meeting at **\[venue\]** to work together through a course on **\[subject\]** in a supportive, peer-based group. We won’t have a teacher—we’ll use the online course and our personal experiences to learn together.
>
> There are no prerequisites for the course, but access to a laptop and some experience of using the internet would be helpful.
>
> For more information, visit **\[link to website or sign-up page\]** or send an email to **\[email\]** for more information.

### **External email template**

Are there other organizations in your town that would want to know about the learning circle? For example, local historical societies will have members who are interested in history courses and after school poetry clubs might be interested in creative writing learning circles. 

If your learning circle takes place in a venue that has a schedule, public calendar, or newsletter, ask the administrators if you can add a notice about the learning circle.

> We thought you might be interested in a learning project taking place in your community. We are going to be hosting a learning circle, a free, peer-led study group for learners who want to take online courses together in a public space. Each week, learners will meet for approximately 90 minutes to work through learning materials about **\[subject\]** together.
>
> The learning circle will take place at **\[venue\]** and run from **\[start time\]** to **\[end time\]** on the following dates: **\[dates\]**.
>
> Interested people can learn more and sign up at **\[sign-up page link\]**. Please pass this message on to anyone in your community who you think might be interested, and get in touch if you have any questions!

### **Facebook message template**

Does your community use Facebook? If so, try this post as a first step. Remember, people get a lot of information via social media, so to be really impactful, post reminders to Facebook about once per day. Remember to tag any individuals, projects, locations or groups who you think might be interested in joining your learning circle.

> Interested in **\_\_**\(course subject\)_**\_**_? Don’t want to do it alone? Join a \#learningcircle at **\_\_**\(venue\)_**\_**_ to meet each week and work through an online course together. The Learning Circle starts **\_\_**\(start date\)**\_\_**. For more information and to apply online: _**\_**_ \(link to website\) _**\_**_.

### Twitter template

If your community uses Twitter for sharing information, then you can use the two template Tweets below to get started. To really get noticed, you should tweet these messages at least 3 times per day, and come up with a hashtag so people can search for the messages \(we recommend using \#learningcircles\). Remember to add the link to your Learning Circle website, too!

> Learn \[course subject\] together at \[venue\]. \#learningcircles start \[start date\]. Sign up: \[link to website\]

> In \#\[city\]? Want to learn together? Join \#learningcircles at \[venue\]. Sign up: \[link to website\]
