# Facilitating Group Learning

Learning circles are facilitated, not taught, which means you don't need to be a teacher or a subject matter expert in order to successfully host a learning circle: 

The facilitator's role is to maintain the fidelity of the learning circle model \(e.g. cultivating a supportive environment, keeping discussion on track, ending each meeting on time\), but you’re not responsible for what happens during each meeting.

All of the resources and methodologies referenced in this handbook—the [weekly structure](https://handbook.p2pu.org/methodology/learning-circle-structure), the [activities](https://handbook.p2pu.org/methodology/learning-circle-structure#learn-and-do), the [courses](https://handbook.p2pu.org/courses/finding-courses)—have all been developed to help you lead a successful learning circle. That being said, facilitation can still feel daunting, especially at first. 

The good news is that facilitation is a practice, and that you needn’t stress about getting it “perfect” right away. Growing comfortable as a learning circle facilitator will be a continuous process of trying, reflecting, and iterating. And you needn’t do this alone. The P2PU community is here to help -- our welcome committee, community forum, monthly facilitator calls, and weekly reflection prompts are each designed to help you refine your practice and grow confident and comfortable in the facilitator role.

What follows are some of the most common questions and worries we hear from facilitators, followed by specific strategies for addressing them.

## Facilitation Strategies

### Encouraging Engagement

A big component of peer-based learning is being able to share thoughts, ideas and experiences with the group. One common first step is to collectively create group norms to help your learning circle run effectively. all learners should contribute to the creation of the group norms that will provide  guidance on how to have respectful conversation and engagement. \(See Group Expectations\) The creation of group norms can also help to create social Cohesion. It establishes that “we” as a group have control and input into how “we” operate as a group. Learners are more likely to participate in a process that they feel that they have ownership of.

### Managing Expectations

When learning something new, optimism can quickly turn into discouragement. For instance, it’s unlikely that somebody with no programming background will get a fancy tech job after one HTML/CSS Learning Circle.To navigate this, express confidence that learners can achieve their goals, while also being realistic and aware of what is possible in six weeks. However, they will gain a better understanding of how to build a website, get a sense as to whether this is a subject they’d like to continue in, and have a peer group of like-minded individuals they’ve gotten to know.At the beginning of a learning circle, it is important to check-in and ask everyone what their goals are for the learning circle.  It is very likely that your learners will have a wide array of goals. Once you have an understanding of each learner’s goals, you’ll be able to respond to this energy productively.  You can have  learners share their goals with the group if that is appropriate or have them write down their goals for their own personal reflection if the learning circle focuses on sensitive or more personal topics.  And remember to check in periodically on the goals you set at the beginning of the circle as they may change throughout the process.

### Establishing your Role

Sometimes when people are new to the learning circle experience, they need some time to adjust to learning without a teacher.  Learners will ask you many content related questions, since you are the closest thing to the traditional teacher in the room. When this happens, your response should demonstrate that their peers are a valuable resource, and that most questions are answerable by the group. In a learning circle we are all teachers and learners.  As the facilitator you are not responsible for giving all the answers, you too are a learner. Encourage all participants to share information by redirecting questions addressed to you as a teacher back to the group, you can use the prompt Does anyone else know, or have any thoughts about….  If you and the group get in the habit of asking questions to the whole group, it can go a long way to relieve the facilitator of the pressures of functioning as a teacher.

### Managing Discussion Flows

When you think about discussion you probably think about people gathered together and speaking out loud to one another, and this is the normal expectation for in person and virtual meetings with video conferencing. However sometimes you may need to promote other types of non-verbal communication to get a group to interact. Maybe you have some shy people in person or you may have some people who might have technical difficulties or limitations with their personal set up.  Here are a few alternatives that you can try. If you can see everyone you can try hand gestures such as thumbs up or thumbs down. This allows for participants to give a quick check in and may spark more verbal conversation when they see the responses of other learners. In online meetings, the embedded chat channel can serve as a nice space for conversation and an essential place for link sharing. It may also be the case that some participants do not have access to a working microphone and are therefore only able to communicate via the chat. If you use the chat function in addition to verbal communication make sure to check it regularly so that people who use the chat don’t feel left out of the conversation or start running a side conversation.

### Sitting with Silence

Silence can be awkward and nerve wracking for someone trying to facilitate a discussion. You may feel like people are not engaged if they don’t respond quickly, however silence can also be an opportunity for people to gather their thoughts. To encourage others in the group to contribute to the discussion practice keeping quiet. Don’t rush in to fill the awkward silence. If you have trouble with keeping quiet try counting to10 or 30 in your head. One of your fellow learning circle participants may then rush to fill the silence. So keep quiet, especially in the beginning.

### Delegating Responsibilities 

Sometimes facilitators  can feel like facilitation may become a burden, or time consuming if you already have lots of other work to do. But it is important to remember that the group as a whole is responsible for this “peer-learning experience” and as a facilitator you can empower your fellow learners to take charge of their own learning making the role of the facilitator smaller and smaller over time. As the learning circle progresses, you can start asking learners to take on some extra responsibility, such as:

* Summarizing the week’s material at the beginning of each meeting
* Setting up beforehand and cleaning up afterwards
* Sharing a resource or article that relates to the course content
* Helping a fellow learner who is struggling
* Bringing snacks

### Working with a Co-Facilitator

You can also find support from working with a co-worker or two within your organization to help you manage your learning circle. Co-facilitation with a team might be for you if you would like to have built in support from the beginning without waiting for other learners to volunteer to assist.. If you co-faciitate with other people you each can take on a part of the facilitation responsibilities. To make sure that co-facilitation works smoothly make sure to coordinate weekly check-in meetings with your co-facilitators to make sure everyone is on the same page about their part of the facilitation responsibilities which can include:

* Managing the P2PU dashboard, and sending group messages
* Leading the discussion
* Synthesizing discussion/notes
* Managing chat
* Asynchronous support/tech support

### Mediating Conflicts

Depending on the topic and how passionate your participants are about the subject materials conflicts can arise. It’s not possible to know what kind of conflicts will arise but you can handle those by using your group norms that your learning circle established on the first day. \(See Group Expectations\) Group norms are not just for the first day you can revisit them at the end or beginning of subsequent meetings to make sure that your group norms still fit your group’s needs. It's okay for the group to change them as necessary, to make sure that the learning circle is and continues to be a comfortable and fair exchange of ideas and information.

We also like these tactical tips from [this article and TED Talk by Adar Cohen](https://ideas.ted.com/3-steps-to-having-difficult-but-necessary-conversations/):

1. **Move toward—not away from—conflict:** Conflict can be an opportunity to explore a problem or concern more deeply. Engage participants with questions that allow them to explain their opinions or comments.
2. **Act as if you don’t know anything about the situation \(even if you do\):** Acting as if you don’t know anything gives you the space to learn and hear information that you may not have, if you immediately jumped in with your personal assumptions.
3. **Keep quiet, especially at the beginning:** Silence is not a bad thing, allow silence to happen, and try to think of it as an opportunity.  Silence is an opportunity for people to reflect, and gather their thoughts, and it can also be a space for a different person to speak up and share with the group.

### Sharing information between meetings

If your group has lively discussion and finds that they would rather spend time having discussion rather than reading together it may make your meeting more efficient to do reading outside of the normal meetings. In this case if the learners all agree you can have everyone do readings on their own to make more time for in person discussion.  In addition it can be helpful to follow-up with learners after the regular meeting time, you can send meeting wrap up notes to all participants after each meeting in case they were absent or had some technical difficulties or connectivity issues. Weekly Wrap up meeting messages can make sure that all participants have access to any information or important takeaways that were shared during the meeting, or that came up after the meeting. 

### Contributing your experiences

What if you do know a lot about the topic at hand? Your experience and skills are as much a part of the learning community as everybody else’s, and you can and should certainly bring in your perspective. Just be mindful of your power in the group -- disclose, but don’t impose….  When disclosing personal knowledge about a subject be mindful not to rush in with the answer but to allow the group the opportunity to explore questions and ideas first. Also instead of always sharing information you know, think about sharing where you found or learned about that information as a resource for others.

### Finding “the answer”

What if the group is stuck? If you are not a subject expert and your course content is not as clear as you would like, it's time to explore other external or supplemental resources.  If you don’t have an answer it's okay to look it up, both facilitator and learners can look up answers and share back with the group in the following meeting.  If you’re having trouble figuring out where to look for answers you can try looking through some of P2PU’s [Topic guides](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/popular-topics/82) on various subjects.  You can also ask a reference librarian at your local library for assistance with finding resources.  Or you and other learners can search on your own for some resources and bring those back to the group to discuss.  Remember we are all learners and teachers in a learning circle and so anyone and everyone can help find answers.
