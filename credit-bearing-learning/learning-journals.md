# Nominating a Course for Credit

To nominate a new online course for college credit, contact [**collegeunbound@p2pu.org**](mailto:collegeunbound@p2pu.org). We'll review the course and create a learning journal and facilitator guide to support its accreditation.

You can find a list of available learning journals for approved credit-bearing courses in our [Facilitator Resources](https://docs.p2pu.org/credit-bearing-learning/facilitator-resources) section.

### How do learning journals work?

Learning journals are designed to help learners reflect upon what they have learned, deepen their understanding, and make their notes more accessible when needed.&#x20;

Each credit hour awarded by College Unbound requires 45 hours of engaged student learning, and learning journals help students structure their time outside of learning circle sessions. Students deepen their engagement with course content by completing the following activities adapted from the learning journal [Question Bank](https://docs.p2pu.org/facilitation/question-bank):

* **Weekly Reflection Questions:** Ask learners to share a reaction, insight, and/or question that they are taking away from the learning circle session.&#x20;
* **Content Review Questions:** Create opportunities for learners to reflect on content from the course, to share it in their own words, and to connect it to past learning experiences.&#x20;
* **Assignments:** Assign learners to independently read or watch material related to the course and to respond with a reflection.&#x20;
* **Final Reflections:** Ask learners to reflect on the course by describing their experiences, naming their initial expectations, and sharing their next steps in 1-2 pages.
