# Credit-Bearing Resources

With support from Walmart, P2PU, College Unbound, and Providence Public Library have [developed a pathway](https://info.p2pu.org/2021/07/21/bringing-college-credits-to-libraries-with-peer-led-learning-circles/) from library-based learning circles to college credit. For now, this project is only open to individuals who have participated in a P2PU credit-bearing learning circle training ([see upcoming events](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/)) using free online [Courses Approved for Credit](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/currently-approved-courses) by College Unbound.

The primary difference between standard learning circles and learning circles for credit is that credit-seeking participants must complete a personal [**learning journal**](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/nominating-a-course-for-credit), which includes a weekly reflection, a wrap-up activity in their learning circle, and a few assignments that are part of the course.&#x20;

### Before the Learning Circle Begins

1. Participate in a P2PU credit-bearing learning circle training ([see upcoming events](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/) or [contact us](https://www.p2pu.org/en/help/)).
2. Create a learning circle using one of the [approved courses](currently-approved-courses.md), or [nominate a new course for credit](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/facilitator-resources#nominating-a-course-for-credit).
3. Email us at collegeunbound@p2pu.org to add your learning circle to the [College Unbound signup page](https://www.p2pu.org/collegeunbound/) for increased promotional visibility.
4. Add information about credit to your signup page and promotional materials.

> Participants in this learning circle have the option to earn college credit from College Unbound. In order to earn credit, you must complete a learning journal while participating in the learning circle. For more information, [refer to the FAQs](https://docs.p2pu.org/frequently-asked-questions#credit-bearing-faqs).&#x20;

### During the Learning Circle

1. During the first meeting, make sure everybody who wants to apply for credit has their own copy of the learning journal, referring to [Credit-Bearing FAQs for learners](../frequently-asked-questions.md#credit-bearing-faqs) as needed.
2. Remind participants that you will not be grading or correcting the learning journal. Submit any questions about learning journals and the credit process to collegeunbound@p2pu.org.
3. Throughout the learning circle, check in with participants seeking credit to make sure they are completing their weekly learning journal questions.
4. When the learning circle ends, remind credit-seeking participants they have an additional three weeks to submit their completed learning journal to collegeunbound@p2pu.org.
