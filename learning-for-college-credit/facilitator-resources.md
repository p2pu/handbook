# Facilitator Resources

With support from Walmart, P2PU, College Unbound, and Providence Public Library have [developed a pathway](https://info.p2pu.org/2021/07/21/bringing-college-credits-to-libraries-with-peer-led-learning-circles/) from library-based learning circles to college credit. For now, this project is only open to individuals who have participated in a P2PU credit-bearing learning circle training ([see upcoming events](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/)) using free online courses that have been vetted by CU (see below).

The primary difference between standard learning circles and learning circles for credit is that credit-seeking participants must complete a personal **learning journal**, which includes a weekly reflection, a wrap-up activity in their learning circle, and a few assignments that are part of the course. All of this information is included in each learning journal for the course.

Once you've completed a credit-bearing training workshop, simply create a learning circle like you normally would and let us know you'd like it to be credit-bearing. We'll make sure you have all the right materials and that your learning circle shows up on the [CU signup page](https://www.p2pu.org/collegeunbound/) (if you want).&#x20;
