# Credit-Bearing Resources

With support from Walmart, P2PU, College Unbound, and Providence Public Library have [developed a pathway](https://info.p2pu.org/2021/07/21/bringing-college-credits-to-libraries-with-peer-led-learning-circles/) from library-based learning circles to college credit. For now, this project is only open to individuals who have participated in a P2PU credit-bearing learning circle training ([see upcoming events](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/)) using free online [Courses Approved for Credit](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/currently-approved-courses) by College Unbound.

The primary difference between standard learning circles and learning circles for credit is that credit-seeking participants must complete a personal [**learning journal**](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/nominating-a-course-for-credit), which includes a weekly reflection, a wrap-up activity in their learning circle, and a few assignments that are part of the course.&#x20;

### Before the Learning Circle Begins

1. Participate in a P2PU credit-bearing learning circle training ([see upcoming events](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/) or [contact us](https://www.p2pu.org/en/help/)).
2. Create a learning circle using one of the [approved courses](currently-approved-courses.md), or [nominate a new course for credit](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/facilitator-resources#nominating-a-course-for-credit).
3. Email us at collegeunbound@p2pu.org to add your learning circle to the [CU signup page](https://www.p2pu.org/collegeunbound/) for increased promotional visibility.
4. Add information about credit to your signup page and promotional materials.

> Participants in this learning circle have the option to earn college credit from College Unbound. In order to earn credit, you must complete a learning journal while participating in the learning circle. For more information, [refer to the FAQs](https://docs.p2pu.org/frequently-asked-questions#credit-bearing-faqs).&#x20;

### During the Learning Circle

1. During the first meeting, make sure everybody who wants to apply for credit has their own copy of the learning journal, referring to [our learner FAQs](../frequently-asked-questions.md#credit-bearing-faqs) as needed.
2. Remind participants that you will not be grading our correcting the learning journal. All questions about the learning journals and credit process should be submitted to collegeunbound@p2pu.org.
3. Throughout the learning circle, you can check in on participants who are seeking credit to make sure they are keeping up with their weekly learning journal questions.
4. When the learning circle ends, remind participants that they have an additional three weeks to submit their completed learning journal to collegeunbound@p2pu.org in order to earn credit.
