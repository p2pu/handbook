# Nominating a Course for Credit

If you'd like to run a learning circle for college credit using a course that isn't yet approved, [fill out this ten question Google Form](https://forms.gle/sFWjGhuucWFNZDRX7) and somebody from CU or P2PU will follow up with you within two days. From there, we'll review the course together and help you create a learning journal and facilitator guide.

You can find a list of courses that have already been approved (as well as their accompanying learning journals) in our [Facilitator Resources](https://docs.p2pu.org/credit-bearing-learning/facilitator-resources) section.

### Developing a New Learning Journal

Once we've approved a new course, the next step is to create the learning journal that participants will use to document their learning experience (while facilitator guides are also helpful, they aren't mandatory for the credit process). Learning journals are designed to help learners reflect upon what they have learned, deepen their understanding, and make their notes more accessible when needed. Learning Journals comprise five unique components, three of which remain the same for every course.

1. **Weekly Reflection:** A recurring reflection that asks learners to share a reaction, insight, and/or question that they are taking away from the learning circle session. (This question is is the same for each course and need not change each week).&#x20;
2. **Weekly Prompt:** A content-specific question that serves as an opportunities for learners to reflect on the course materials in their own words, and to connect it to past learning experiences. (Use our [discussion question bank](../facilitation/question-bank.md) to help develop these questions).
3. **Final Reflection:** A final reflection on the course that asks participants to describe their experiences, reflection on their initial expectations, and share their next steps in 1-2 pages. (This reflection is the same for every course).
4. **Final Assignment:** An independent project that should take participants 6-8 hours to complete. This may require engaging with supplemental materials outside of the learning circle.
5. **Course Review:** A paragraph-long reflection on the course materials (this review is the same for every course).

We advise that you don't spend too much time building the learning journal before your course is proposed for credit. Once it is, we'll help you get it ready!
