# Frequently Asked Questions

### What can I expect in the first meeting?

In the first meeting, you’ll get to know your fellow learners and familiarize yourself with the course materials that you’ll be using for the duration of the learning circle. Your facilitator may contact you before the first meeting with additional information.

### What topics can I learn about?

Learning circles use free online courses as the basis of study. These courses come from online course providers, universities, and non-profit organizations from around the world. Any online course can be used, so long as it is free for participants and not in violation of the terms of service of the course provider.

### Do learning circles cost money?

No. Learning circles are free to participate in and free to start.

### Do I get a certificate at the end of the learning circle?

P2PU is not a university and does not offer any accredited degree certificates. Some of the online courses that are used in learning circles provide the option to purchase a certificate, which you can do if you so choose. It is, however, possible to receive a certificate of completion following your learning circle. You should speak to your facilitator if this is of interest to you.

### What personal information do I need to provide in order to participate?

When you sign up for a learning circle, your email address and information provided in the signup form will be shared with the facilitator of the learning circle. You should expect to receive at least one email when you sign up, one email per meeting and maybe one or two other emails from your facilitator with extra information and/or a request to provide your feedback on the experience. Additionally, if you opt-in to hearing about future learning opportunities from P2PU, you will receive infrequent emails (4 messages per year or less) from P2PU. If at any point you’d like to withdraw consent, you can do so by following the instructions included in all messages we send you. Alternatively, you can also withdraw consent on [this page](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/optout/).

If you’d like more information, you can review our [privacy policy](https://www.p2pu.org/privacy/), [terms of service](https://www.p2pu.org/terms/) or contact us at [privacy@p2pu.org](mailto:privacy@p2pu.org).

### Can I facilitate a learning circle?

Yes! With a little bit of practice, anybody can facilitate a learning circle. [Create an account](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/register/?next=/en/login\_redirect/), explore the resources on [facilitation](https://docs.p2pu.org/facilitation/facilitation-basics) in this knowledge base, and attend a [facilitator orientation](https://www.p2pu.org/en/events/) to get started.

## Credit-Bearing FAQs

These additional FAQs only apply to learning circle participants who are pursuing college credit through our partnership with College Unbound.

### **What do I need to do to earn credit?**&#x20;

To be eligible to earn academic credit for a learning circle, you must complete all of the course material, fill out an accompanying learning journal, and complete one additional project, the details of which vary by course. Everything must be submitted to College Unbound within three weeks of the end of the learning circle.

### **What does earning credit mean in this case?**&#x20;

This list of [Currently Approved Courses](https://docs.p2pu.org/learning-for-college-credit/currently-approved-courses) are available for learners to take for college credit. You can take each course once. We are always working on adding more courses!&#x20;

Credit is offered toward an undergraduate degree at [College Unbound](https://www.collegeunbound.org) (120 credit hours total). You can also use the transcript that you will receive to demonstrate your learning to employers. Other higher education institutions usually will not accept transfer credit for informal learning. If you have questions about pursuing a degree at College Unbound, you can contact [collegeunbound@p2pu.org](mailto:collegeunbound@p2pu.org).

### Do I need to apply for credit in order to participate?

No. These learning circles are open to everybody, and pursuing credit is completely optional.&#x20;

### Do I need to attend each meeting?&#x20;

You need to complete the course and the reflections. If you miss one or two but catch up, that’s okay.

### Is there a cost?&#x20;

No, the learning circle and the application for credit are free. If you need an official College Unbound transcript, it will cost $2.25 to $3.50, but College Unbound does not require that you purchase an official transcript.

### How do I submit my learning journal?

Email your completed journal to [collegeunbound@p2pu.org](mailto:collegeunbound@p2pu.org) within three weeks of your final learning circle meeting.

### Who is my learning journal shared with?

Your learning journal will be shared with College Unbound, your learning circle facilitator, and Peer 2 Peer University. Nothing you write will be shared publicly without additional consent. For more, review the [P2PU](https://www.p2pu.org/privacy) and [College Unbound](https://sites.google.com/collegeunbound.org/registrar/ferpa?authuser=0) privacy policies.&#x20;

### What if I have more questions?&#x20;

For questions about learning circles in general, review the P2PU FAQ or reach out directly to your facilitator. For questions about the College Unbound credit process, send an email to Michelle Navarre at [collegeunbound@p2pu.org](mailto:collegeunbound@p2pu.org).
