# Learning Circle Structure

No two learning circles are alike! Ultimately, it's up to the group to decide how they want to work through their learning materials. That being said, there are a few common practices that help surface a peer learning environment and prevent facilitators from slipping into the role of a teacher. 

* **3-12 Learners**: Less than 3 people can start to feel too interpersonal. More than 12 can make it difficult to connect as a group. 
* **90 Minutes for 6-8 Weeks:** This has emerged as a sweet spot, offering enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment. 
* **Meeting structure:** To help facilitators avoid feeling like they need to be setting teaching plans, we recommend a basic and flexible 4-part structure each week of [Check-In](./#check-in), [Read & Watch](./#read-and-watch), [Do/Make/Say/Think](./#do-make-say-think), and [Reflection](./#reflection).

3. Reflection

## **Check-In**

Starting and finishing each meeting as a group is a core component of learning circles. A consistent check-in time warms up group conversation and is a reliable way to build community with icebreakers, recap previous sessions, and set expectations for the meeting. 

A good check-in can:

* Creates a space for everyone to speak or feel heard
* Encourages creativity and playfulness
* Sheds light on common points of interest and experience
* Allows each participant to introduce themselves however they want
* Models group participation
* Does not take too much time
* Bonus: Introduces tools, topics or questions that both relate to the meeting and can be used to reflect upon at a later time or date

### Check-In Activities to Try

#### ‚ùìOpen-Ended Questions

Ask each participant to respond to a question. We strive to find questions that can be answered in a single sentence but still provide an opportunity to share personal \(but not too personal\) information with the group. 

Our favorite questions are:

* What is something that you learned recently?
* What‚Äôs a fun fact about the community you come from?
* What‚Äôs your favorite food?
* What would your superpower be?

You can also ask goal-oriented questions:

* What brings you here today?
* What is the one thing you will need help with this week?
* What would you like to learn today?

#### üì¶ Treasure Hunt

Ask people to find or share something small through their webcam. This can be both very low stakes \(‚Äúfind something blue!‚Äù\) or personal \(‚Äúfind something meaningful to you‚Äù\) or specific \(‚Äúfind a fridge magnet‚Äù\). 

#### üë™ Class Photo

Ask each participant to draw a self-portrait of themselves with their name on a post-note or collaborative whiteboard like [AwwApp](https://awwapp.com/).

#### üì∫ Media Share-Out

Being online presents the opportunity to share media with one another. This can also be a great, low-stakes way to help participants become more comfortable using shared notes documents and copying media from the internet. A few examples include:

* Paste an image of your favorite \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in a shared notes document
* Search for a .[gif](https://giphy.com/)  or [emoji](https://emojipedia.org/) that matches your mood
* Share your favorite meme

#### üìîRecap

Ask someone to give a summary of what was discussed during the previous meeting or meetings. This reminds the group of what was covered already and can be helpful for someone who missed a previous meeting. 

#### üìúGroup Expectations

Talk about expectations for the group to draw in participation from all group members and help craft group identity. This can be as simple as discussing what makes a good team or more in-depth by creating a code of conduct or a list of roles and responsibilities. Here are some common questions about expectations that are useful to address early on:

* Do we want to work through activities on a projector/screen share or work on our own? 
* Do we want to commit to doing work outside of the learning circle? Homework or no homework?

## **Learn & Do**

Read & Watch refers to the time spent with the learning content and is where most of the expert knowledge lives. This can take many forms, from an article or a textbook chapter, to a playlist of videos, to a hybrid format of interactive content. 

While Read & Watch can sometimes be passive, Do/Make/Say/Think is its active counterpart. \(These can also be interspersed throughout a meeting.\) D/M/S/T refers to a hands-on group project or discussion to solidify what people have just read or watched. Sometimes these activities come easily \(e.g. if the topic is public speaking, learners can take turns sharing short monologues\), and sometimes they require some creativity to effectively reinforce the goals of the module. 

## **Reflection**

A planned closing space helps the group collectively consider what was covered during the meeting and provide feedback to guide their experience moving forward. As a baseline, we often recommend using a Plus/Delta: each participant shares a plus \(something that went well\) and a delta \(something they‚Äôd like to change for the next meeting\). These contributions can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting.

**A good reflection can:**

* Create a space for everyone to give feedback
* Encourage participants to recognize and celebrate past learning
* Transition the group to work and life outside of the learning circle
* End the meeting on a positive and hopeful note

### Reflection Activities to Try

#### ‚ûï Plus/Delta \(In-Person, Online, 3‚Äì20 min\)

A quick easy reflection activity is asking everybody one thing that went well that day \(‚Äúplus‚Äù\) and one thing to change for the next week \(‚Äúdelta‚Äù\). These contributions are a great way for facilitators to get fresh feedback and can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting. This can be answered out loud or typed out into a video chat or collaborative agenda if time is short.

#### üí¨ One Word Response \(In-Person, Online, &lt;2 min\)

![Example of written word responses via Valentina Ruffoni/CMX Connect](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bH2q_rCmlvK2vq3SeztotKo02m0m-WHgxqeCg-vVNYGsTezCdH0GNZhguIJoCvmJGL1V6vkttc0YqBDVULdZJuQXMBG_tusb2Ar3c4dxOapQOtm8an209BkPl0Hmciwql2E3FGof)

A quick way to end a meeting while still getting feedback from everyone is to ask participants to say, type, or write one word that represents how they are feeling or their plans for the week. For example, ‚ÄúHow would you describe our time together in one-word?‚Äù

#### ‚ùì Open Question \(In-Person, Online, 1-3 min/participant\)

In groups of 10 or less, you can ask a specific question as a wrap-up. Our general rule of thumb is to not ask anything that you‚Äôre not genuinely interested in hearing the answer to. 

Our favorite questions are:

* What‚Äôs something that surprised you this week?
* What is one thing we can do differently next week to make our virtual meeting space more hospitable?
* What are our immediate next steps?

#### üôè Give Thanks \(In-Person, Online, 1-2 min/participant\)

Ask everyone to give thanks to someone else in the group for something they did during the meeting or during the previous weeks. The question could be focused towards those inside the learning circle, or could be directed outwards to certain people \(family, friends\) who helped make the learning process easier.
