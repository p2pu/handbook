# Reflections

A planned closing space helps the group collectively consider what was covered during the meeting and provide feedback to guide their experience moving forward.

## **What makes a good reflection activity?** 

* Creates a space for everyone to give feedback
* Encourages participants to recognize and celebrate past learning
* Transitions the group to work and life outside of the learning circle
* Ends on a positive and hopeful note

## Activities to Try

#### ‚ûï Plus/Delta \(In-Person, Online, 3‚Äì20 min\)

A quick easy reflection activity is asking everybody one thing that went well that day \(‚Äúplus‚Äù\) and one thing to change for the next week \(‚Äúdelta‚Äù\). These contributions are a great way for facilitators to get fresh feedback and can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting. This can be answered out loud or typed out into a video chat or collaborative agenda if time is short.



#### üí¨ One Word Response \(In-Person, Online, &lt;2 min\)

A quick way to end a meeting while still getting feedback from everyone is to ask participants to say, type, or write one word that represents how they are feeling or their plans for the week. For example, ‚ÄúHow would you describe our time together in one-word?‚Äù

#### 

#### ‚ùì Open Question \(In-Person, Online, 1-3 min/participant\)

In groups of 10 or less, you can ask a specific question as a wrap-up. Our general rule of thumb is to not ask anything that you‚Äôre not genuinely interested in hearing the answer to. 

Our favorite questions are:

* What‚Äôs something that surprised you this week?
* What is one thing we can do differently next week to make our virtual meeting space more hospitable?
* What are our immediate next steps?



#### üôè Give Thanks \(In-Person, Online, 1-2 min/participant\)

Ask everyone to give thanks to someone else in the group for something they did during the meeting or during the previous weeks. The question could be focused towards those inside the learning circle, or could be directed outwards to certain people \(family, friends\) who helped make the learning process easier.
