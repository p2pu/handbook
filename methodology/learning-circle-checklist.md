# Learning Circle Checklist

Facilitating a learning circle requires about 3 hours per week on the part of the facilitator, most of which is spent in the actual learning circle. In addition to that, some time is often needed for set up, clean-up \(if meeting in person\), communicating with learners between each meeting, and familiarizing with the upcoming week of course materials.

Below is a recommended checklist that outlines the steps needed to get your learning circle running. We recommend that you schedule your first learning circle at least four weeks in the future, but you can compress or expand this timeline to suit your needs. If you don’t already have a dedicated group of learners, we recommend spending four weeks promoting your learning circle once you’ve finalized the date, time, course, and location.

## First Steps

* \*\*\*\*[**Set Your Intent**](../courses/set-your-intent.md) ****by connecting with your own goals, your community, or your colleagues to identify the learning objectives and audience you want to support with your learning circle
* Decide your learning circle details:
  * Choice of course/learning materials
  * Number of meetings and length of each session
  * Meeting Dates & Times
  * \*\*\*\*[**Set Up Your Space**](../facilitation/set-up-your-space.md) \(where you'll meet\)
* Confirm supplies will be available \(laptops, headphones, pens, nametags, snacks, etc.\)
* Reach out to affiliated or relevant local organizations to share your plans and look for advertising opportunities

## 4 weeks prior

* Create your learning circle using P2PU's free tools \(see [Creating learning circles](../tools-and-resources/tools-for-learning-circles/creating-learning-circles.md)\)
* Begin promoting online and offline \(see [Promote your learning circle](../facilitation/promotion-and-outreach.md)\)
* Connect with local communities to find prospective participants

## 2 weeks prior

* Begin making a facilitator's guide by exploring the learning materials and creating an outline for how you want to proceed through the materials 
* Visit your learning circle's management page to check in on your current number of of registrations and close sign-ups if needed \(see [**Managing Learning Circles**](../tools-and-resources/tools-for-learning-circles/managing-learning-circles.md)\)

## 1 week prior

* Follow up with all registered learners to make sure they plan to attend, ask about accessibility considerations, and make plans for any technical troubleshooting \(as needed\)
* If in-person, confirm reservations with your meeting venue
* Gather supplies

## Before each meeting

* Edit reminder messages – these will be sent automatically 2 days before the meeting and will include an RSVP link and information about the meeting space \(unless you choose to edit that out\)

## After each meeting

* Capture feedback and communication with learners
  * Facilitators should complete this process after each meeting - this process will include communicating to learners about the meeting, sharing insights with the P2PU community and capturing stats
    * Go to your [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/)
    * Under My Learning Circles, click Manage to the right of the course
    * To the right of each meeting, click Capture feedback - you will be asked to enter the following:
      * For learners: Write a brief summary of this week's learning circle - You may want to include your impressions of how it went, plus/delta feedback, and anything the group agreed on having completed before the next meeting. This will be automatically sent to learners two days before next week's meeting.
      * For the rest of us \(P2PU community\): Anything you want to share? - What went well this week? What surprised you? Any funny stories? We'll pull what you write here into our community newsletters and updates.
      * How many people attended? These stats will be captured for MCL’s event stats
      * Rating how the week's class went

## Final learning circle meeting

* Surveys 
  * The P2PU portal will send emails to both the learners and facilitators before the final meetings, asking them to complete a survey about their experience
    * Ask learners to complete this survey during the final meeting during plus/delta
    * Facilitators should complete their survey immediately after the final session
    * The survey results \(called Insight Report\) will be shared with learners, facilitators and team organizers 2 days after the last meeting
