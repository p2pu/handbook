# Learning Circle Structure

No two learning circles are alike! Ultimately, it's up to the group to decide how they want to work through their learning materials. That being said, there are a few common practices that help surface a peer learning environment and prevent facilitators from slipping into the role of a teacher. 

* **3-12 Learners**: Less than 3 people can start to feel too interpersonal. More than 12 can make it difficult to connect as a group. 
* **90 Minutes for 6-8 Weeks:** This has emerged as a sweet spot, offering enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment. 
* **Meeting structure:** To help facilitators avoid feeling like they need to be setting teaching plans, we recommend a basic and flexible 4-part structure each week of [Check-In](learning-circle-structure.md#check-in), [Read & Watch](learning-circle-structure.md#read-and-watch), [Do/Make/Say/Think](learning-circle-structure.md#do-make-say-think), and [Reflection](learning-circle-structure.md#reflection).

## **Check-In**

Starting and finishing each meeting as a group is a core component of learning circles. A consistent check-in time warms up group conversation and is a reliable way to build community with icebreakers, recap previous sessions, and set expectations for the meeting. 

A good check-in can:

* Creates a space for everyone to speak or feel heard
* Encourages creativity and playfulness
* Sheds light on common points of interest and experience
* Allows each participant to introduce themselves however they want
* Models group participation
* Does not take too much time
* Bonus: Introduces tools, topics or questions that both relate to the meeting and can be used to reflect upon at a later time or date

### Check-In Activities to Try

#### ❓Open-Ended Questions

Ask each participant to respond to a question. We strive to find questions that can be answered in a single sentence but still provide an opportunity to share personal \(but not too personal\) information with the group. 

Our favorite questions are:

* What is something that you learned recently?
* What’s a fun fact about the community you come from?
* What’s your favorite food?
* What would your superpower be?

You can also ask goal-oriented questions:

* What brings you here today?
* What is the one thing you will need help with this week?
* What would you like to learn today?

#### 📦 Treasure Hunt

Ask people to find or share something small through their webcam. This can be both very low stakes \(“find something blue!”\) or personal \(“find something meaningful to you”\) or specific \(“find a fridge magnet”\). 

#### 👪 Class Photo

Ask each participant to draw a self-portrait of themselves with their name on a post-note or collaborative whiteboard like [AwwApp](https://awwapp.com/).

#### 📺 Media Share-Out

Being online presents the opportunity to share media with one another. This can also be a great, low-stakes way to help participants become more comfortable using shared notes documents and copying media from the internet. A few examples include:

* Paste an image of your favorite \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in a shared notes document
* Search for a .[gif](https://giphy.com/)  or [emoji](https://emojipedia.org/) that matches your mood
* Share your favorite meme

#### 📔Recap

Ask someone to give a summary of what was discussed during the previous meeting or meetings. This reminds the group of what was covered already and can be helpful for someone who missed a previous meeting. 

#### 📜Group Expectations

Talk about expectations for the group to draw in participation from all group members and help craft group identity. This can be as simple as discussing what makes a good team or more in-depth by creating a code of conduct or a list of roles and responsibilities. Here are some common questions about expectations that are useful to address early on:

* Do we want to work through activities on a projector/screen share or work on our own? 
* Do we want to commit to doing work outside of the learning circle? Homework or no homework?

## **Learn & Do**

Read & Watch refers to the time spent with the learning content and is where most of the expert knowledge lives. This can take many forms, from an article or a textbook chapter, to a playlist of videos, to a hybrid format of interactive content. 

While Read & Watch can sometimes be passive, Do/Make/Say/Think is its active counterpart. \(These can also be interspersed throughout a meeting.\) D/M/S/T refers to a hands-on group project or discussion to solidify what people have just read or watched. Sometimes these activities come easily \(e.g. if the topic is public speaking, learners can take turns sharing short monologues\), and sometimes they require some creativity to effectively reinforce the goals of the module. 

Learning circles are guided by the needs and interests of the group. Outside of facilitated check-in and reflection activities, the learners themselves can decide how they want to learn together by choosing any number of activities to help them learn. 

Learning activities, especially check-ins and reflection activities, can be introduced in a variety of different learning formats. Try out some of these formats with any check-in or reflection activity. 

### Learning Formats to Try

#### 👀 Read & Watch as a Group

Online courses are often designed to be read and used individually. Depending on the interests and needs of the group, online text, videos, and even quizzes can be read and used in a group setting

For example: 

* Have someone read the text out loud, or take turns reading different parts of the text.
* Project or screen share a video and watch together at the same time.
* Nominate someone new each meeting to be in charge of presenting an overview of what to expect from the online course.

#### 👥Breakout Rooms

Create spaces for smaller group discussion to reflect on a question or work together on a problem.  Try creating breakout groups when there are 8 or more people in a learning circle. We like using [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) for breakout rooms because it is so easy to create and link participants to new video chat rooms. In- person,  breakout groups can be created based on similar interests and experiences, or randomly assigned in order to make sure everyone gets to know each other. 

#### 🐝 Buzz / Think-Pair-Share

Whenever information is presented to a large group, ask everyone to turn to their partner for a quick “buzz” to talk about what was seen, heard, or understood. A buzz can last 30 seconds or a number of minutes. With a little more effort, everyone can be encouraged to think by themselves, converse with a partner, and share their perspective back with everyone else, or simply, “think-pair-share”. 

#### 🏖 Beach Ball / Talking Stick

Get everybody involved in a discussion while removing the facilitator as the mediator of every interaction. Start by presenting a prompt or question to the group and ask somebody to answer. When they’ve finished, they can pass the question onto somebody else by calling out their name, like a beach ball, or alternatively, pass an object that acts as a talking stick. 

#### 🐟 Fishbowl

A fishbowl is a small group discussion which takes place inside a larger circle of participants who listen-in. It allows a large group to listen to different opinions while taking the pressure to speak off of the rest of the group. To do this online, simply nominate a small group of people \(4 works well\) to respond to a question. If somebody wants to join the discussion circle, they can raise their hand to join and kick somebody who has already spoken out of the discussion circle.

####  ⌨️ Typed Response

Ask everyone to share type responses to a specific or open question. This can be done through an online chat box, or using a collaborative document like a Google Doc or [Etherpad](https://etherpad.p2pu.org/). It allows everyone a chance to participate, especially those who do not feel comfortable vocalizing their opinion, or simply cannot for other reasons. Encourage everyone to type +1 next to a statement that people agree with or like, which acts like a virtual high-five or thumbs up. To make sure all responses are heard, it can also be helpful to have one person read off responses for everyone else. 

#### 🎓 Outside Expertise

Bring the group on a field trip or host an expert in-person or virtually to answer questions or provide feedback. Learning circles are based on the expertise of the group, but that doesn’t mean you can’t look outside for answers to your group's questions.

#### 🔁 Critique and Feedback 

Modeling good feedback and constructive criticism can help make learners more comfortable sharing with one another. Learning circles that have tangible outcomes such as creating a website or a piece of written work benefit from having people share their work and receive feedback. When introducing feedback, we recommend offering some guidelines such as: 

* Those offering feedback should include something positive first
* Ensure recommendations specific and actionable
* When receiving feedback, try to listen with open ears, and remember that we all have each other’s best interests at heart. 

#### 😿Talk About Failure

Create space for your learning circle to share some mistakes made or struggles felt during the learning circle. This should help learners feel less pressure about always “knowing” the right answer and allow them to feel more comfortable asking peers for help. For example, you might ask someone for a struggle they had with the course material, what lesson was learned from that experience, and how they can imagine using that lesson going forward.

## **Energizers**

Energizers can add the perfect amount of spice to any meeting and can be seriously fun! A quick note though that energizers should be brief and shouldn’t replace learning activities that help learners work together.

**A good energizer can:**

* Makes the body move
* Encourages creativity and play
* Invites group participation
* Creates a transition
* Does not make anyone feel uncomfortable

### **Energizer Activities to Try**

#### ⏰ Take A Break **\(**In-person, Online\)

If you feel the need for a break, it may already be too late! So, take a break already! Stretch, eat some cookies, try a guided meditation, go for a walk, watch a music video, have a dance party, share recipes, or play an online game like [Pictionary](https://gartic.io/) or [Codenames](https://www.horsepaste.com/).

#### 💥 The Shakedown \(In-person\)

Ask everyone to stand up, form a circle, and prepare to shake every limb of their body together. Explain that you will start with your right arm, and shake it 8 times while counting \(loudly if possible!\) each shake “1- 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8!”  Explain that after this you will follow this with eight shakes of your left arm, right foot, and then left foot. After that, you’ll repeat the same pattern but with four shakes each, then two, then one. End with a big cheer!

#### 🥥 Coconut \(In-person; Online\)

Ask everyone to spell coconut with their body taking the shape of each letter “C-O-C-O-N-U-T”. It is a very easy way to simply stretch your body in a playful way. 

#### 👂 Storytelling \(In-person; Online\)

Share a story from your own life, one that you heard, or one that relates to a recent topic, theme, or question. If you ask someone else to share a story, make sure to ask them in advance to prepare. Here’s an example of fun parable from [The Barefoot Guide](https://www.barefootguide.org/):

Three blind men touched an elephant, one touching at the front, one at the side and one at the back. The first told his friends: ‘An elephant is long and about as thick as a man’s arm.’ The second one said, ‘No, it isn’t. It’s flat and feels like paper. It is very thin.’ The third one said, ‘You’re both wrong. It’s large and hard and hot, smelly stuff comes out of it.’

#### 🏡 Room Tour \(Online\)

Giving everybody 30 seconds to share the view out of their window \(or show off part of the room that they are in\) can help people better understand each other and their unique contexts. We only recommend using this as a check-in after a group has met a few times and everybody feels comfortable with one another.

## **Reflection**

A planned closing space helps the group collectively consider what was covered during the meeting and provide feedback to guide their experience moving forward. As a baseline, we often recommend using a Plus/Delta: each participant shares a plus \(something that went well\) and a delta \(something they’d like to change for the next meeting\). These contributions can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting.

**A good reflection can:**

* Create a space for everyone to give feedback
* Encourage participants to recognize and celebrate past learning
* Transition the group to work and life outside of the learning circle
* End the meeting on a positive and hopeful note

### Reflection Activities to Try

#### ➕ Plus/Delta \(In-Person, Online, 3–20 min\)

A quick easy reflection activity is asking everybody one thing that went well that day \(“plus”\) and one thing to change for the next week \(“delta”\). These contributions are a great way for facilitators to get fresh feedback and can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting. This can be answered out loud or typed out into a video chat or collaborative agenda if time is short.

#### 💬 One Word Response \(In-Person, Online, &lt;2 min\)

![Example of written word responses via Valentina Ruffoni/CMX Connect](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bH2q_rCmlvK2vq3SeztotKo02m0m-WHgxqeCg-vVNYGsTezCdH0GNZhguIJoCvmJGL1V6vkttc0YqBDVULdZJuQXMBG_tusb2Ar3c4dxOapQOtm8an209BkPl0Hmciwql2E3FGof)

A quick way to end a meeting while still getting feedback from everyone is to ask participants to say, type, or write one word that represents how they are feeling or their plans for the week. For example, “How would you describe our time together in one-word?”

#### ❓ Open Question \(In-Person, Online, 1-3 min/participant\)

In groups of 10 or less, you can ask a specific question as a wrap-up. Our general rule of thumb is to not ask anything that you’re not genuinely interested in hearing the answer to. 

Our favorite questions are:

* What’s something that surprised you this week?
* What is one thing we can do differently next week to make our virtual meeting space more hospitable?
* What are our immediate next steps?

#### 🙏 Give Thanks \(In-Person, Online, 1-2 min/participant\)

Ask everyone to give thanks to someone else in the group for something they did during the meeting or during the previous weeks. The question could be focused towards those inside the learning circle, or could be directed outwards to certain people \(family, friends\) who helped make the learning process easier.
