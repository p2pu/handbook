# Energizers

Energizers can add the perfect amount of spice to any meeting and can be seriously fun! A quick note though that energizers should be brief and shouldn’t replace learning activities that help learners work together.

## **Activities to Try**

#### ⏰ Take A Break **\(**In-person, Online\)

If you feel the need for a break, it may already be too late! So, take a break already! Stretch, eat some cookies, try a guided meditation, go for a walk, watch a music video, have a dance party, share recipes, or play an online game like [Pictionary](https://gartic.io/) or [Codenames](https://www.horsepaste.com/).



#### 💥 The Shakedown \(In-person\)

Ask everyone to stand up, form a circle, and prepare to shake every limb of their body together. Explain that you will start with your right arm, and shake it 8 times while counting \(loudly if possible!\) each shake “1- 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8!”  Explain that after this you will follow this with eight shakes of your left arm, right foot, and then left foot. After that, you’ll repeat the same pattern but with four shakes each, then two, then one. End with a big cheer!



#### 🥥 Coconut \(In-person; Online\)

Ask everyone to spell coconut with their body taking the shape of each letter “C-O-C-O-N-U-T”. It is a very easy way to simply stretch your body in a playful way. 



#### 👂 Storytelling \(In-person; Online\)

Share a story from your own life, one that you heard, or one that relates to a recent topic, theme, or question. If you ask someone else to share a story, make sure to ask them in advance to prepare. Here’s an example of fun parable from [The Barefoot Guide](https://www.barefootguide.org/):

Three blind men touched an elephant, one touching at the front, one at the side and one at the back. The first told his friends: ‘An elephant is long and about as thick as a man’s arm.’ The second one said, ‘No, it isn’t. It’s flat and feels like paper. It is very thin.’ The third one said, ‘You’re both wrong. It’s large and hard and hot, smelly stuff comes out of it.’



#### 🏡 Room Tour \(Online\)

Giving everybody 30 seconds to share the view out of their window \(or show off part of the room that they are in\) can help people better understand each other and their unique contexts. We only recommend using this as a check-in after a group has met a few times and everybody feels comfortable with one another.
