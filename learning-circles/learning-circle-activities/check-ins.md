# Check-in + Icebreakers

Starting each meeting as a group is a core component of learning circles. A consistent check-in time warms up group conversation, introduces and re-introduces group members to each other, recaps previous sessions, and sets expectations for the meeting.

## What makes a good check-in?

* Creates a space for everyone to speak or feel heard
* Encourages creativity and playfulness
* Sheds light on common points of interest and experience
* Allows each participant to introduce themselves however they want
* Models group participation
* Does not take too much time
* Bonus: Introduces tools, topics or questions that both relate to the meeting and can be used to reflect upon at a later time or date

## Activities to Try

#### ❓Short, Open-Ended, Interesting Questions

Ask each participant to respond to a question. We strive to find questions that can be answered in a single sentence but still provide an opportunity to share personal \(but not too personal\) information with the group. 

Our favorite questions are:

* What is something that you learned recently?
* What’s a fun fact about the community you come from?
* What’s your favorite food?
* What would your superpower be?

You can also ask goal-oriented questions:

* What brings you here today?
* What is the one thing you will need help with this week?
* What would you like to learn today?



#### 📦 Treasure Hunt

Ask people to find or share something small through their webcam. This can be both very low stakes \(“find something blue!”\) or personal \(“find something meaningful to you”\) or specific \(“find a fridge magnet”\). 



#### 👪 Class Photo

Ask each participant to draw a self-portrait of themselves with their name on a post-note or collaborative whiteboard like [AwwApp](https://awwapp.com/).

#### 📺 Media Share-Out

Being online presents the opportunity to share media with one another. This can also be a great, low-stakes way to help participants become more comfortable using shared notes documents and copying media from the internet. A few examples include:

* Paste an image of your favorite \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in a shared notes document
* Search for a .[gif](https://giphy.com/)  or [emoji](https://emojipedia.org/) that matches your mood
* Share your favorite meme



#### 📔Recap

Ask someone to give a summary of what was discussed during the previous meeting or meetings. This reminds the group of what was covered already and can be helpful for someone who missed a previous meeting. 



#### 📜Group Expectations

Talk about expectations for the group to draw in participation from all group members and help craft group identity. This can be as simple as discussing what makes a good team or more in-depth by creating a code of conduct or a list of roles and responsibilities. Here are some common questions about expectations that are useful to address early on:

* Do we want to work through activities on a projector/screen share or work on our own? 
* Do we want to commit to doing work outside of the learning circle? Homework or no homework?
