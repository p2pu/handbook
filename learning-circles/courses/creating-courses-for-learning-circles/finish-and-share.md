# Finish and Share

Once your course is complete, [create a free P2PU account](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/register/?next=/en/course/create/) and add your course to [P2PU’s course database](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/). In the future, we’ll add email notifications to let you know when a facilitator is using your course—in the meantime, let us know at [thepeople@p2pu.org](mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org) when you’ve added a course, and we’ll give you a heads up when it’s being used.

  
If you’d like to try your hand at facilitating your course, check out our [learning about learning circles course](https://p2pu.github.io/learning-about-learning-circles/)!
