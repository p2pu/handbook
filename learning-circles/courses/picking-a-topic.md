# Picking a topic



## Gathering input from your community

Before you start running learning circles, you may want to run a small outreach project in your community to both get the word out and better understand the needs of potential learning circle participants. Below, we outline a few ways that the P2PU community has developed or used to integrate community opinions into learning circle program planning!

#### The Q method <a id="the-q-method"></a>

The Q Method is a participatory public bulletin used to solicit feedback about course topics that people are interested in. It’s named after our friend Qumisha \(a.k.a. Q\) from Detroit Public Library, who came up with the idea as a way to promote learning circles at her library branch.

![The Q method in action](https://community.p2pu.org/uploads/default/original/1X/833de6b1554b25041b78c207017c36fdbf316714.jpg)

As you can see in the example above, the most popular course with 20 votes was Marketing in a Digital World. There was a tie for second place – Introduction to Public Speaking and Social Entrepreneurship 101 both received 16 votes. Based on the results, the Q offered both the marketing and public speaking courses as learning circles.

What’s great about the Q Method is that it both invites community contribution for deciding topics, and serves to promote the program. This concept has been re-used by learning circle facilitators around the world, and can also have applications for other community feedback issues, such as strategic planning, programming decision-making, and understanding community satisfaction and engagement. Our our community forum, you can [download a template](https://community.p2pu.org/t/q-method-for-documenting-community-interests/2699/2) to create your own Q method and see how others have implemented it around the world.

#### Focus groups <a id="focus-groups"></a>

If you want more feedback on program design, you may wish to bring a small group of people together and ask them questions about what they are looking for in learning circles. This is a great way to not only generate data and insight, but also to get to know people and build relationships. In Kenya, libraries run focus groups as part of their learning circle training; we’ve adapted their focus group questions for you [on the forum](https://community.p2pu.org/t/library-patron-focus-group/3129).

#### Community partnerships <a id="community-partnerships"></a>

Watch this video clip of Athanasia Fitos, a librarian from Miami, discussing the role of community partnerships in building a successful learning circle community. As you watch, think about \(or discuss\) your responses to these questions:

* How do you currently understand and document the needs, interests, and experiences of the various communities you serve?
* Which communities does your organization not serve who you might want to reach?
* What audiences or communities do you aim to serve through learning circles, and what might benefit or interest them most?
