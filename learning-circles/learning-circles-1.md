# What is a learning circle?

Learning circles are free facilitated study groups for those who want to learn new things together. 

A learning circle typically has four components:

1. a [**facilitator**](../facilitation/intro-to-facilitation/) – the person who decides to start the learning circle, who organizes meetings, and who encourages the atmosphere of peer-to-peer learning. Facilitators are not teachers and do not need to be experts in the learning circle topic. 
2. \*\*\*\*[**learning materials**](../learning-materials/finding-courses/) – the guiding source of knowledge, often a free online course or other accessible learning resource
3. [**learners**](../drafts/intro-to-learners.md) – a group that meets regularly to work through the learning materials together
4. a **dedicated meeting room** – traditionally a reliable in-person space, usually at a public place like a library or community center, but primarily online in 2020 \(see [Virtual Learning Circles](../facilitation/virtual-learning-circles.md)\)

## **The Basics**

Learning circles meet regularly, often 90 minutes/week for 6-8 weeks. Though the schedule is flexible based on a group’s needs, this seems to be a sweet spot that offers enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment.

Despite variations in practice, there are five traits that every learning circle should have:

* **Free:** No cost to attend or access the learning materials
* **Recurring:** Multiple meetings allow for building relationships between learners and reinforcing knowledge over time
* **Structured:** Follows a reliable weekly process \(typically a check-in, reading/watching, activities, and reflection\)
* **Facilitated:** Gently guided but not taught—with a little practice and training, anyone should be able to facilitate! 
* **Collaborative:** Scheduled discussions and activities that engage the entire group

## Why learning circles?

P2PU champions learning circles because they are an equalizer. Traditional higher education programs can reinforce inequality by creating barriers to access to the people who stand to benefit the most. Online education, while wide-reaching and often free, is still inaccessible to many people and can be intimidating, lonely, or ineffective once you’ve gained access. Learning circles are designed to help people find a supportive environment to learn about a topic they care about, while developing relationships with members of their community along the way. 

Since starting the program in 2015, we’ve found that learning circles:

* Lead to retention rates 10x higher than online courses alone
* Increase people’s agency as self-guided learners
* Increase people’s ability to set and achieve their own learning goals
* Invigorate community-based learning in libraries and education centers
* Create viable alternatives to formal education
* Support digital inclusion for people new to online learning

## Tools for Learning Circles

When learning circles [first began in Chicago]() in 2015, we didn’t have any tools and software. We just worked with librarians to find online courses and helped them become better facilitators. Over time, as the project has grown, we have iteratively developed a number of tools and resources to create an online ecosystem for learning circle facilitators. 

These tools are designed to improve the experience for facilitators and learners alike. On the one hand, we aim to make organizing face-to-face meetings easier by simplifying promotion, sending reminders, aggregating data, etc. On the other hand, we seek to create a strong, networked, community where a learning circle in one city can benefit, in a small way, from the fact that learning circles are also happening elsewhere. Learning circles have been successful so far not just because we have developed a single resource, but because there is a vibrant community of practice that has formed around a series of tools and resources.

Our tools address the needs of three different groups:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Learners**](../drafts/intro-to-learners.md). People participating in learning circles.
2. \*\*\*\*[**Facilitators**](../facilitation/intro-to-facilitation/). People facilitating learning circles.
3. \*\*\*\*[**Organizers**](../facilitation/organizers/). People organizing several learning circles across a town, city, or country. \(Often the organizer is also a facilitator\).
