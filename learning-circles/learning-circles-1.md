# Why learning circles?

P2PU champions learning circles because they are an equalizer. Traditional higher education programs can reinforce inequality by creating barriers to access to the people who stand to benefit the most. Online education, while wide-reaching and often free, is still inaccessible to many people and can be intimidating, lonely, or ineffective once you’ve gained access. Learning circles are designed to help people find a supportive environment to learn about a topic they care about, while developing relationships with members of their community along the way. 

Since starting the program in 2015, we’ve found that learning circles:

* Lead to retention rates 10x higher than online courses alone
* Increase people’s agency as self-guided learners
* Increase people’s ability to set and achieve their own learning goals
* Invigorate community-based learning in libraries and education centers
* Create viable alternatives to formal education
* Support digital inclusion for people new to online learning
