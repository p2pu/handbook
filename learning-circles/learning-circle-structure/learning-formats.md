# Learning Formats

Learning circles are guided by the needs and interests of the group. Outside of facilitated check-in and reflection activities, the learners themselves can decide how they want to learn together by choosing any number of activities to help them learn. 

Learning activities, especially check-ins and reflection activities, can be introduced in a variety of different learning formats. Try out some of these formats with any check-in or reflection activity.

## Formats to Try

#### 👀 Read & Watch as a Group

Online courses are often designed to be read and used individually. Depending on the interests and needs of the group, online text, videos, and even quizzes can be read and used in a group setting

For example: 

* Have someone read the text out loud, or take turns reading different parts of the text.
* Project or screen share a video and watch together at the same time.
* Nominate someone new each meeting to be in charge of presenting an overview of what to expect from the online course.



#### 👥Breakout Rooms

Create spaces for smaller group discussion to reflect on a question or work together on a problem.  Try creating breakout groups when there are 8 or more people in a learning circle. We like using [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) for breakout rooms because it is so easy to create and link participants to new video chat rooms. In- person,  breakout groups can be created based on similar interests and experiences, or randomly assigned in order to make sure everyone gets to know each other. 



#### 🐝 Buzz / Think-Pair-Share

Whenever information is presented to a large group, ask everyone to turn to their partner for a quick “buzz” to talk about what was seen, heard, or understood. A buzz can last 30 seconds or a number of minutes. With a little more effort, everyone can be encouraged to think by themselves, converse with a partner, and share their perspective back with everyone else, or simply, “think-pair-share”. 



#### 🏖 Beach Ball / Talking Stick

Get everybody involved in a discussion while removing the facilitator as the mediator of every interaction. Start by presenting a prompt or question to the group and ask somebody to answer. When they’ve finished, they can pass the question onto somebody else by calling out their name, like a beach ball, or alternatively, pass an object that acts as a talking stick. 



#### 🐟 Fishbowl

A fishbowl is a small group discussion which takes place inside a larger circle of participants who listen-in. It allows a large group to listen to different opinions while taking the pressure to speak off of the rest of the group. To do this online, simply nominate a small group of people \(4 works well\) to respond to a question. If somebody wants to join the discussion circle, they can raise their hand to join and kick somebody who has already spoken out of the discussion circle.



####  ⌨️ Typed Response

Ask everyone to share type responses to a specific or open question. This can be done through an online chat box, or using a collaborative document like a Google Doc or [Etherpad](https://etherpad.p2pu.org/). It allows everyone a chance to participate, especially those who do not feel comfortable vocalizing their opinion, or simply cannot for other reasons. Encourage everyone to type +1 next to a statement that people agree with or like, which acts like a virtual high-five or thumbs up. To make sure all responses are heard, it can also be helpful to have one person read off responses for everyone else. 



#### 💭 Word Cloud

World clouds can be a nice way to generate quick and anonymous feedback on specific questions. We like to use [Answer Garden](https://answergarden.ch/) for this, as there is no log in required and results are displayed in real time.

#### 

#### 🚌 Field Trip

Go on a field trip to somewhere relevant to what you are learning. Wherever the group decides to go, make sure everyone is able to join. 



#### 🎓 Outside Expertise

Host an expert in-person or virtually to answer questions or provide feedback. Learning circles are based on the expertise of the group, but that doesn’t mean you can’t look outside for answers to your group's questions.



#### 🔁 Critique and Feedback 

Modeling good feedback and constructive criticism can help make learners more comfortable sharing with one another. Learning circles that have tangible outcomes such as creating a website or a piece of written work benefit from having people share their work and receive feedback. When introducing feedback, we recommend offering some guidelines such as: 

* Those offering feedback should include something positive first
* Ensure recommendations specific and actionable
* When receiving feedback, try to listen with open ears, and remember that we all have each other’s best interests at heart. 



#### 😿Talk About Failure

Create space for your learning circle to share some mistakes made or struggles felt during the learning circle. This should help learners feel less pressure about always “knowing” the right answer and allow them to feel more comfortable asking peers for help. 

For example, you might ask someone for a struggle they had with the course material, what lesson was learned from that experience, and how they can imagine using that lesson going forward.
