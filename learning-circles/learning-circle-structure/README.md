# Typical structure

No two learning circles look the same! Ultimately, it's up to the facilitator and the learners to decide how they want to work through their learning materials. 

Typically, learning circle meetings follow a basic and flexible 4-part structure that creates ample space for empowering individual learning goals, building group relationships, and supporting the facilitator. This can be a helpful baseline for organizing knowledge into a learner-friendly format.

## Group Expectations

To create a supportive and effective space for everyone, it’s recommended that the group agrees on a set of norms for their meetings ****during the first meeting. It is the facilitator’s role to uphold these expectations and remind participants when they are not upheld. Here are some suggestions \(adapted from [Our Data Bodies’ Digital Defense Playbook](https://www.odbproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ODB_DDP_HighRes_Single.pdf)\) that work well for most learning circles:

* **Respect the speaker:** When a person is sharing, allow them to share their complete thoughts without interruption. Listen actively and push past distractions from digital devices and your environment when possible.
* **Speak from “I” and eye:** Share from your own experience and perspective. Don’t assume the experiences of others and avoid making comments or generalizations about entire communities. Keep your shares focused on what you see, what you notice, and what you feel.
* **Lean into discomfort:** Some topics may be uncomfortable to talk about because of personal experiences or oppressions felt in your everyday life. The emotions and feelings that may arise are normal and can help enhance authentic learning together if shared. Participants are asked to lean into their own discomfort and honor the space for others to do the same.
* **Step up, step back:** A learning circle is most effective when all voices can be heard. If you find yourself speaking often, step back and create space for others to share their ideas. If you’re someone who prefers to listen, push yourself to speak out and share at least once per meeting.
* **Keep it confidential:** What happens in the learning circle stays in the learning circle. Respect the privacy of your fellow participants and don’t share others’ stories without consent.

## **Check-In**

Starting and finishing each meeting as a group is a core component of learning circles. A consistent check-in time warms up group conversation and is a reliable way to build community with icebreakers, recap previous sessions, and set expectations for the meeting.

## **Read & Watch**

Read & Watch refers to the time spent with the learning content and is where most of the expert knowledge lives. This can take many forms, from an article or a textbook chapter, to a playlist of videos, to a hybrid format of interactive content. 

## **Do/Make/Say/Think**

While Read & Watch can sometimes be passive, Do/Make/Say/Think is its active counterpart. \(These can also be interspersed throughout a meeting.\) D/M/S/T refers to a hands-on group project or discussion to solidify what people have just read or watched. Sometimes these activities come easily \(e.g. if the topic is public speaking, learners can take turns sharing short monologues\), and sometimes they require some creativity to effectively reinforce the goals of the module. 

## **Reflection**

A planned closing space helps the group collectively consider what was covered during the meeting and provide feedback to guide their experience moving forward. As a baseline, we often recommend using a Plus/Delta: each participant shares a plus \(something that went well\) and a delta \(something they’d like to change for the next meeting\). These contributions can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting.
