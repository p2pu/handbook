# Typical structure

No two learning circles are alike! Ultimately, it's up to the facilitator and the learners to decide how they want to work through their learning materials. That being said, there are a few common practices across the board. 

* **90 minutes/week for 6-8 weeks:**  Some learning circles only meet three or four times, others extend for more than a year! However, 90 minutes a week for 6-8 weeks seems to be a sweet spot that offers enough time and space to build a productive group culture without being alienating due to the time commitment.
* **Four-part meeting structure:** To help facilitators avoid feeling like they need to be setting teaching plans, we recommend a basic and flexible 4-part structure that creates ample space for empowering individual learning goals, building group relationships, and supporting the facilitator, as described below. This can be a helpful baseline for organizing knowledge into a learner-friendly format. 
* Follows a reliable weekly process \(typically a check-in, reading/watching, activities, and reflection\)
* **Facilitated, not taught:** Gently guided but not taught—with a little practice and training, anyone should be able to facilitate! 
* **Collaborative:** Scheduled discussions and activities that engage the entire group

Typically, each learning circle meeting follows a

## **Check-In**

Starting and finishing each meeting as a group is a core component of learning circles. A consistent check-in time warms up group conversation and is a reliable way to build community with icebreakers, recap previous sessions, and set expectations for the meeting.

## **Read & Watch**

Read & Watch refers to the time spent with the learning content and is where most of the expert knowledge lives. This can take many forms, from an article or a textbook chapter, to a playlist of videos, to a hybrid format of interactive content. 

## **Do/Make/Say/Think**

While Read & Watch can sometimes be passive, Do/Make/Say/Think is its active counterpart. \(These can also be interspersed throughout a meeting.\) D/M/S/T refers to a hands-on group project or discussion to solidify what people have just read or watched. Sometimes these activities come easily \(e.g. if the topic is public speaking, learners can take turns sharing short monologues\), and sometimes they require some creativity to effectively reinforce the goals of the module. 

## **Reflection**

A planned closing space helps the group collectively consider what was covered during the meeting and provide feedback to guide their experience moving forward. As a baseline, we often recommend using a Plus/Delta: each participant shares a plus \(something that went well\) and a delta \(something they’d like to change for the next meeting\). These contributions can seed a brief conversation about ways to improve the next meeting.
